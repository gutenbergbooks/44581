<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I.<br />

<span class="stl">THE MAN WITH THE ROLLER.</span></h2>


<p>On the edge of that vast tract of East Anglia,
which retains its ancient name of the Fens,
there may be found, by those who know where
to seek it, a certain village called Stoneground.
It was once a picturesque village. To-day it is
not to be called either a village, or picturesque.
Man dwells not in one &ldquo;house of clay,&rdquo; but in
two, and the material of the second is drawn
from the earth upon which this and the neighbouring
villages stood. The unlovely signs of
the industry have changed the place alike in
aspect and in population. Many who have
seen the fossil skeletons of great saurians
brought out of the clay in which they have
lain from pre-historic times, have thought that
the inhabitants of the place have not since
changed for the better. The chief habitations,
however, have their foundations not upon clay,
but upon a bed of gravel which anciently gave
to the place its name, and upon the highest part
of this gravel stands, and has stood for many
centuries, the Parish Church, dominating the
landscape for miles around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Stoneground, however, is no longer the
inaccessible village, which in the middle ages
stood out above a waste of waters. Occasional
floods serve to indicate what was once its
ordinary outlook, but in more recent times the
construction of roads and railways, and the
drainage of the Fens, have given it freedom of
communication with the world from which it
was formerly isolated.</p>

<p>The Vicarage of Stoneground stands hard
by the Church, and is renowned for its spacious
garden, part of which, and that (as might be
expected) the part nearest the house, is of
ancient date. To the original plot successive
Vicars have added adjacent lands, so that the
garden has gradually acquired the state in
which it now appears.</p>

<p>The Vicars have been many in number.
Since Henry de Greville was instituted in the
year 1140 there have been 30, all of whom have
lived, and most of whom have died, in successive
vicarage houses upon the present site.</p>

<p>The present incumbent, Mr. Batchel, is a
solitary man of somewhat studious habits, but
is not too much enamoured of his solitude to
receive visits, from time to time, from schoolboys
and such. In the summer of the year
1906 he entertained two, who are the occasion
of this narrative, though still unconscious of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
their part in it, for one of the two, celebrating
his 15th birthday during his visit to Stoneground,
was presented by Mr. Batchel with a
new camera, with which he proceeded to
photograph, with considerable skill, the surroundings
of the house.</p>

<p>One of these photographs Mr. Batchel
thought particularly pleasing. It was a view
of the house with the lawn in the foreground.
A few small copies, such as the boy&rsquo;s camera
was capable of producing, were sent to him by
his young friend, some weeks after the visit,
and again Mr. Batchel was so much pleased
with the picture, that he begged for the
negative, with the intention of having the view
enlarged.</p>

<p>The boy met the request with what seemed
a needlessly modest plea. There were two
negatives, he replied, but each of them had, in
the same part of the picture, a small blur for
which there was no accounting otherwise than
by carelessness. His desire, therefore, was to
discard these films, and to produce something
more worthy of enlargement, upon a subsequent
visit.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel, however, persisted in his
request, and upon receipt of the negative,
examined it with a lens. He was just able to
detect the blur alluded to; an examination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
under a powerful glass, in fact revealed something
more than he had at first detected. The
blur was like the nucleus of a comet as one
sees it represented in pictures, and seemed to
be connected with a faint streak which extended
across the negative. It was, however, so inconsiderable
a defect that Mr. Batchel resolved to
disregard it. He had a neighbour whose
favourite pastime was photography, one who
was notably skilled in everything that pertained
to the art, and to him he sent the
negative, with the request for an enlargement,
reminding him of a long-standing promise to
do any such service, when as had now happened,
his friend might see fit to ask it.</p>

<p>This neighbour who had acquired such skill
in photography was one Mr. Groves, a young
clergyman, residing in the Precincts of the
Minster near at hand, which was visible from
Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s garden. He lodged with a Mrs.
Rumney, a superannuated servant of the Palace,
and a strong-minded vigorous woman still,
exactly such a one as Mr. Groves needed to
have about him. For he was a constant trial
to Mrs. Rumney, and but for the wholesome
fear she begot in him, would have converted
his rooms into a mere den. Her carpets and
tablecloths were continually bespattered with
chemicals; her chimney-piece ornaments had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
been unceremoniously stowed away and replaced
by labelled bottles; even the bed of Mr.
Groves was, by day, strewn with drying films
and mounts, and her old and favourite cat
had a bald patch on his flank, the result of
a mishap with the pyrogallic acid.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rumney&rsquo;s lodger, however, was a great
favourite with her, as such helpless men are
apt to be with motherly women, and she took
no small pride in his work. A life-size portrait
of herself, originally a peace-offering, hung in
her parlour, and had long excited the envy of
every friend who took tea with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Groves,&rdquo; she was wont to say, &ldquo;is
a nice gentleman, <span class="f8">AND</span> a gentleman; and
chemical though he may be, I&rsquo;d rather wait
on him for nothing than what I would on
anyone else for twice the money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every new piece of photographic work was
of interest to Mrs. Rumney, and she expected
to be allowed both to admire and to criticise.
The view of Stoneground Vicarage, therefore,
was shown to her upon its arrival. &ldquo;Well may
it want enlarging,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;and it no
bigger than a postage stamp; it looks more
like a doll&rsquo;s house than a vicarage,&rdquo; and with
this she went about her work, whilst Mr. Groves
retired to his dark room with the film, to see
what he could make of the task assigned to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Two days later, after repeated visits to his
dark room, he had made something considerable;
and when Mrs. Rumney brought him
his chop for luncheon, she was lost in admiration.
A large but unfinished print stood upon
his easel, and such a picture of Stoneground
Vicarage was in the making as was calculated
to delight both the young photographer and
the Vicar.</p>

<p>Mr. Groves spent only his mornings, as a
rule, in photography. His afternoons he gave
to pastoral work, and the work upon this
enlargement was over for the day. It required
little more than &ldquo;touching up,&rdquo; but it was
this &ldquo;touching up&rdquo; which made the difference
between the enlargements of Mr. Groves and
those of other men. The print, therefore, was
to be left upon the easel until the morrow,
when it was to be finished. Mrs. Rumney and
he, together, gave it an admiring inspection
as she was carrying away the tray, and what
they agreed in admiring most particularly was
the smooth and open stretch of lawn, which
made so excellent a foreground for the picture.
&ldquo;It looks,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rumney, who had once
been young, &ldquo;as if it was waiting for someone
to come and dance on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Groves left his lodgings&mdash;we must now
be particular about the hours&mdash;at half-past two,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
with the intention of returning, as usual, at five.
&ldquo;As reg&rsquo;lar as a clock,&rdquo; Mrs. Rumney was wont
to say, &ldquo;and a sight more reg&rsquo;lar than some
clocks I knows of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon this day he was, nevertheless, somewhat
late, some visit had detained him unexpectedly,
and it was a quarter-past five when he
inserted his latch-key in Mrs. Rumney&rsquo;s door.</p>

<p>Hardly had he entered, when his landlady,
obviously awaiting him, appeared in the passage:
her face, usually florid, was of the colour
of parchment, and, breathing hurriedly and
shortly, she pointed at the door of Mr. Groves&rsquo;
room.</p>

<p>In some alarm at her condition, Mr. Groves
hastily questioned her; all she could say was:
&ldquo;The photograph! the photograph!&rdquo; Mr. Groves
could only suppose that his enlargement
had met with some mishap for which Mrs.
Rumney was responsible. Perhaps she had
allowed it to flutter into the fire. He turned
towards his room in order to discover the
worst, but at this Mrs. Rumney laid a trembling
hand upon his arm, and held him back. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
go in,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;have your tea in the parlour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Mr. Groves, &ldquo;if that is
gone we can easily do another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone,&rdquo; said his landlady, &ldquo;I wish to
Heaven it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>The ensuing conversation shall not detain
us. It will suffice to say that after a considerable
time Mr. Groves succeeded in quieting
his landlady, so much so that she consented,
still trembling violently, to enter the room
with him. To speak truth, she was as much
concerned for him as for herself, and she was
not by nature a timid woman.</p>

<p>The room, so far from disclosing to Mr.
Groves any cause for excitement, appeared
wholly unchanged. In its usual place stood
every article of his stained and ill-used furniture,
on the easel stood the photograph, precisely
where he had left it; and except that his
tea was not upon the table, everything was in
its usual state and place.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Rumney again became excited
and tremulous, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s there,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Look
at the lawn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Groves stepped quickly forward and
looked at the photograph. Then he turned as
pale as Mrs. Rumney herself.</p>

<p>There was a man, a man with an indescribably
horrible suffering face, rolling the lawn
with a large roller.</p>

<p>Mr. Groves retreated in amazement to
where Mrs. Rumney had remained standing.
&ldquo;Has anyone been in here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a soul,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;I came in to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
make up the fire, and turned to have another
look at the picture, when I saw that dead-alive
face at the edge. It gave me the creeps,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;particularly from not having noticed it
before. If that&rsquo;s anyone in Stoneground, I said
to myself, I wonder the Vicar has him in the
garden with that awful face. It took that hold
of me I thought I must come and look at it
again, and at five o&rsquo;clock I brought your tea in.
And then I saw him moved along right in front,
with a roller dragging behind him, like you
see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Groves was greatly puzzled. Mrs.
Rumney&rsquo;s story, of course, was incredible, but
this strange evil-faced man had appeared in
the photograph somehow. That he had not
been there when the print was made was quite
certain.</p>

<p>The problem soon ceased to alarm Mr.
Groves; in his mind it was investing itself
with a scientific interest. He began to think of
suspended chemical action, and other possible
avenues of investigation. At Mrs. Rumney&rsquo;s
urgent entreaty, however, he turned the photograph
upon the easel, and with only its white
back presented to the room, he sat down and
ordered tea to be brought in.</p>

<p>He did not look again at the picture. The
face of the man had about it something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
unnaturally painful: he could remember, and
still see, as it were, the drawn features, and the
look of the man had unaccountably distressed
him.</p>

<p>He finished his slight meal, and having lit
a pipe, began to brood over the scientific possibilities
of the problem. Had any other photograph
upon the original film become involved
in the one he had enlarged? Had the image of
any other face, distorted by the enlarging lens,
become a part of this picture? For the space of
two hours he debated this possibility, and that,
only to reject them all. His optical knowledge
told him that no conceivable accident could
have brought into his picture a man with a
roller. No negative of his had ever contained
such a man; if it had, no natural causes would
suffice to leave him, as it were, hovering about
the apparatus.</p>

<p>His repugnance to the actual thing had by
this time lost its freshness, and he determined
to end his scientific musings with another inspection
of the object. So he approached the
easel and turned the photograph round again.
His horror returned, and with good cause. The
man with the roller had now advanced to the
middle of the lawn. The face was stricken still
with the same indescribable look of suffering.
The man seemed to be appealing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
spectator for some kind of help. Almost, he
spoke.</p>

<p>Mr. Groves was naturally reduced to a
condition of extreme nervous excitement. Although
not by nature what is called a nervous
man, he trembled from head to foot. With a
sudden effort, he turned away his head, took
hold of the picture with his outstretched hand,
and opening a drawer in his sideboard thrust
the thing underneath a folded tablecloth which
was lying there. Then he closed the drawer
and took up an entertaining book to distract his
thoughts from the whole matter.</p>

<p>In this he succeeded very ill. Yet somehow
the rest of the evening passed, and as it
wore away, he lost something of his alarm. At
ten o&rsquo;clock, Mrs. Rumney, knocking and receiving
answer twice, lest by any chance she
should find herself alone in the room, brought
in the cocoa usually taken by her lodger at that
hour. A hasty glance at the easel showed her
that it stood empty, and her face betrayed her
relief. She made no comment, and Mr. Groves
invited none.</p>

<p>The latter, however, could not make up his
mind to go to bed. The face he had seen was
taking firm hold upon his imagination, and
seemed to fascinate him and repel him at the
same time. Before long, he found himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
wholly unable to resist the impulse to look at it
once more. He took it again, with some indecision,
from the drawer and laid it under the
lamp.</p>

<p>The man with the roller had now passed
completely over the lawn, and was near the left
of the picture.</p>

<p>The shock to Mr. Groves was again considerable.
He stood facing the fire, trembling with
excitement which refused to be suppressed. In
this state his eye lighted upon the calendar
hanging before him, and it furnished him with
some distraction. The next day was his mother&rsquo;s
birthday. Never did he omit to write a letter
which should lie upon her breakfast-table, and
the pre-occupation of this evening had made
him wholly forgetful of the matter. There was
a collection of letters, however, from the pillar-box
near at hand, at a quarter before midnight,
so he turned to his desk, wrote a letter which
would at least serve to convey his affectionate
greetings, and having written it, went out into
the night and posted it.</p>

<p>The clocks were striking midnight as he
returned to his room. We may be sure that he
did not resist the desire to glance at the photograph
he had left on his table. But the results
of that glance, he, at any rate, had not anticipated.
The man with the roller had disappeared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
The lawn lay as smooth and clear as at first,
&ldquo;looking,&rdquo; as Mrs. Rumney had said, &ldquo;as if it
was waiting for someone to come and dance on
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The photograph, after this, remained a
photograph and nothing more. Mr. Groves
would have liked to persuade himself that it
had never undergone these changes which he
had witnessed, and which we have endeavoured
to describe, but his sense of their reality was
too insistent. He kept the print lying for a
week upon his easel. Mrs. Rumney, although
she had ceased to dread it, was obviously relieved
at its disappearance, when it was carried
to Stoneground to be delivered to Mr. Batchel.
Mr. Groves said nothing of the man with the
roller, but gave the enlargement, without comment,
into his friend&rsquo;s hands. The work of
enlargement had been skilfully done, and was
deservedly praised.</p>

<p>Mr. Groves, making some modest disclaimer,
observed that the view, with its
spacious foreground of lawn, was such as could
not have failed to enlarge well. And this lawn,
he added, as they sat looking out of the Vicar&rsquo;s
study, looks as well from within your house
as from without. It must give you a sense of
responsibility, he added, reflectively, to be
sitting where your predecessors have sat for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
so many centuries and to be continuing their
peaceful work. The mere presence before your
window, of the turf upon which good men have
walked, is an inspiration.</p>

<p>The Vicar made no reply to these somewhat
sententious remarks. For a moment he seemed
as if he would speak some words of conventional
assent. Then he abruptly left the room, to
return in a few minutes with a parchment book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your remark, Groves,&rdquo; he said as he seated
himself again, &ldquo;recalled to me a curious bit of
history: I went up to the old library to get the
book. This is the journal of William Longue
who was Vicar here up to the year 1602. What
you said about the lawn will give you an
interest in a certain portion of the journal. I
will read it.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Aug. 1, 1600.&mdash;I am now returned in haste from
a journey to Brightelmstone whither I
had gone with full intention to remain
about the space of two months. Master
Josiah Wilburton, of my dear College of
Emmanuel, having consented to assume
the charge of my parish of Stoneground
in the meantime. But I had intelligence,
after 12 days&rsquo; absence, by a messenger
from the Churchwardens, that Master
Wilburton had disappeared last Monday
sennight, and had been no more seen. So
here I am again in my study to the entire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
frustration of my plans, and can do
nothing in my perplexity but sit and
look out from my window, before which
Andrew Birch rolleth the grass with
much persistence. Andrew passeth so
many times over the same place with his
roller that I have just now stepped without
to demand why he so wasteth his
labour, and upon this he hath pointed out
a place which is not levelled, and hath
continued his rolling.</p>

<p>Aug. 2.&mdash;There is a change in Andrew Birch
since my absence, who hath indeed the
aspect of one in great depression, which
is noteworthy of so chearful a man. He
haply shares our common trouble in
respect of Master Wilburton, of whom we
remain without tidings. Having made
part of a sermon upon the seventh
Chapter of the former Epistle of St.
Paul to the Corinthians and the 27th
verse, I found Andrew again at his task,
and bade him desist and saddle my horse,
being minded to ride forth and take
counsel with my good friend John Palmer
at the Deanery, who bore Master Wilburton
great affection.</p>

<p>Aug. 2 continued.&mdash;Dire news awaiteth me
upon my return. The Sheriff&rsquo;s men have
disinterred the body of poor Master W.
from beneath the grass Andrew was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
rolling, and have arrested him on the
charge of being his cause of death.</p>

<p>Aug. 10&mdash;Alas! Andrew Birch hath been
hanged, the Justice having mercifully
ordered that he should hang by the neck
until he should be dead, and not sooner
molested. May the Lord have mercy on
his soul. He made full confession before
me, that he had slain Master Wilburton
in heat upon his threatening to make me
privy to certain peculation of which I
should not have suspected so old a
servant. The poor man bemoaned his
evil temper in great contrition, and beat
his breast, saying that he knew himself
doomed for ever to roll the grass in the
place where he had tried to conceal his
wicked fact.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Mr. Groves. &ldquo;Has that
little negative got the date upon it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Batchel, as he examined it with his
glass. The boy has marked it August 10. The
Vicar seemed not to remark the coincidence
with the date of Birch&rsquo;s execution. Needless to
say that it did not escape Mr. Groves. But he
kept silence about the man with the roller, who
has been no more seen to this day.</p>

<p>Doubtless there is more in our photography
than we yet know of. The camera sees more
than the eye, and chemicals in a freshly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
prepared and active state, have a power
which they afterwards lose. Our units
of time, adopted for the convenience of
persons dealing with the ordinary movements
of material objects, are of course conventional.
Those who turn the instruments of science
upon nature will always be in danger of seeing
more than they looked for. There is such a
disaster as that of knowing too much, and at
some time or another it may overtake each of
us. May we then be as wise as Mr. Groves in
our reticence, if our turn should come.</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II.<br />

<span class="stl">BONE TO HIS BONE.</span></h2>


<p>William Whitehead, Fellow of Emmanuel
College, in the University of Cambridge, became
Vicar of Stoneground in the year 1731. The
annals of his incumbency were doubtless short
and simple: they have not survived. In his day
were no newspapers to collect gossip, no Parish
Magazines to record the simple events of
parochial life. One event, however, of greater
moment then than now, is recorded in two
places. Vicar Whitehead failed in health after
23 years of work, and journeyed to Bath in what
his monument calls &ldquo;the vain hope of being
restored.&rdquo; The duration of his visit is unknown;
it is reasonable to suppose that he
made his journey in the summer, it is certain
that by the month of November his physician
told him to lay aside all hope of recovery.</p>

<p>Then it was that the thoughts of the patient
turned to the comfortable straggling vicarage
he had left at Stoneground, in which he had
hoped to end his days. He prayed that his successor
might be as happy there as he had been
himself. Setting his affairs in order, as became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
one who had but a short time to live, he
executed a will, bequeathing to the Vicars of
Stoneground, for ever, the close of ground he
had recently purchased because it lay next the
vicarage garden. And by a codicil, he added to
the bequest his library of books. Within a few
days, William Whitehead was gathered to his
fathers.</p>

<p>A mural tablet in the north aisle of the
church, records, in Latin, his services and his
bequests, his two marriages, and his fruitless
journey to Bath. The house he loved, but never
again saw, was taken down 40 years later, and
re-built by Vicar James Devie. The garden,
with Vicar Whitehead&rsquo;s &ldquo;close of ground&rdquo; and
other adjacent lands, was opened out and
planted, somewhat before 1850, by Vicar Robert
Towerson. The aspect of everything has
changed. But in a convenient chamber on the
first floor of the present vicarage the library of
Vicar Whitehead stands very much as he used
it and loved it, and as he bequeathed it to his
successors &ldquo;for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The books there are arranged as he arranged
and ticketed them. Little slips of paper, sometimes
bearing interesting fragments of writing,
still mark his places. His marginal comments
still give life to pages from which all other
interest has faded, and he would have but a dull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
imagination who could sit in the chamber
amidst these books without ever being carried
back 180 years into the past, to the time when
the newest of them left the printer&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>Of those into whose possession the books
have come, some have doubtless loved them
more, and some less; some, perhaps, have left
them severely alone. But neither those who
loved them, nor those who loved them not, have
lost them, and they passed, some century and a
half after William Whitehead&rsquo;s death, into
the hands of Mr. Batchel, who loved them as a
father loves his children. He lived alone, and
had few domestic cares to distract his mind.
He was able, therefore, to enjoy to the full what
Vicar Whitehead had enjoyed so long before
him. During many a long summer evening
would he sit poring over long-forgotten books;
and since the chamber, otherwise called the
library, faced the south, he could also spend
sunny winter mornings there without discomfort.
Writing at a small table, or reading as he
stood at a tall desk, he would browse amongst
the books like an ox in a pleasant pasture.</p>

<p>There were other times also, at which Mr.
Batchel would use the books. Not being a
sound sleeper (for book-loving men seldom are),
he elected to use as a bedroom one of the two
chambers which opened at either side into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
library. The arrangement enabled him to
beguile many a sleepless hour amongst the
books, and in view of these nocturnal visits he
kept a candle standing in a sconce above the
desk, and matches always ready to his hand.</p>

<p>There was one disadvantage in this close
proximity of his bed to the library. Owing, apparently,
to some defect in the fittings of the room,
which, having no mechanical tastes, Mr. Batchel
had never investigated, there could be heard, in
the stillness of the night, exactly such sounds
as might arise from a person moving about
amongst the books. Visitors using the other
adjacent room would often remark at breakfast,
that they had heard their host in the library at
one or two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, when, in fact,
he had not left his bed. Invariably Mr. Batchel
allowed them to suppose that he had been where
they thought him. He disliked idle controversy,
and was unwilling to afford an opening for supernatural
talk. Knowing well enough the sounds
by which his guests had been deceived, he
wanted no other explanation of them than his
own, though it was of too vague a character to
count as an explanation. He conjectured that
the window-sashes, or the doors, or &ldquo;something,&rdquo;
were defective, and was too phlegmatic and too
unpractical to make any investigation. The
matter gave him no concern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Persons whose sleep is uncertain are apt to
have their worst nights when they would like
their best. The consciousness of a special need
for rest seems to bring enough mental disturbance
to forbid it. So on Christmas Eve, in the
year 1907, Mr. Batchel, who would have liked to
sleep well, in view of the labours of Christmas
Day, lay hopelessly wide awake. He exhausted
all the known devices for courting sleep, and, at
the end, found himself wider awake than ever.
A brilliant moon shone into his room, for he
hated window-blinds. There was a light wind
blowing, and the sounds in the library were
more than usually suggestive of a person moving
about. He almost determined to have the
sashes &ldquo;seen to,&rdquo; although he could seldom be
induced to have anything &ldquo;seen to.&rdquo; He disliked
changes, even for the better, and would submit
to great inconvenience rather than have things
altered with which he had become familiar.</p>

<p>As he revolved these matters in his mind, he
heard the clocks strike the hour of midnight,
and having now lost all hope of falling asleep,
he rose from his bed, got into a large dressing
gown which hung in readiness for such occasions,
and passed into the library, with the intention
of reading himself sleepy, if he could.</p>

<p>The moon, by this time, had passed out of
the south, and the library seemed all the darker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
by contrast with the moonlit chamber he had
left. He could see nothing but two blue-grey
rectangles formed by the windows against the
sky, the furniture of the room being altogether
invisible. Groping along to where the table
stood, Mr. Batchel felt over its surface for the
matches which usually lay there; he found, however,
that the table was cleared of everything.
He raised his right hand, therefore, in order to
feel his way to a shelf where the matches were
sometimes mislaid, and at that moment, whilst
his hand was in mid-air, the matchbox was
gently put into it!</p>

<p>Such an incident could hardly fail to disturb
even a phlegmatic person, and Mr. Batchel
cried &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; somewhat nervously.
There was no answer. He struck a match,
looked hastily round the room, and found it
empty, as usual. There was everything, that
is to say, that he was accustomed to see, but
no other person than himself.</p>

<p>It is not quite accurate, however, to say
that everything was in its usual state. Upon
the tall desk lay a quarto volume that he had
certainly not placed there. It was his quite
invariable practice to replace his books upon
the shelves after using them, and what we may
call his library habits were precise and
methodical. A book out of place like this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
was not only an offence against good order,
but a sign that his privacy had been intruded
upon. With some surprise, therefore, he lit
the candle standing ready in the sconce, and
proceeded to examine the book, not sorry, in
the disturbed condition in which he was, to
have an occupation found for him.</p>

<p>The book proved to be one with which he
was unfamiliar, and this made it certain that
some other hand than his had removed it from
its place. Its title was &ldquo;The Compleat
Gard&rsquo;ner&rdquo; of M. de la Quintinye made
English by John Evelyn Esquire. It was not a
work in which Mr. Batchel felt any great
interest. It consisted of divers reflections on
various parts of husbandry, doubtless entertaining
enough, but too deliberate and discursive
for practical purposes. He had certainly
never used the book, and growing restless now
in mind, said to himself that some boy having
the freedom of the house, had taken it
down from its place in the hope of finding
pictures.</p>

<p>But even whilst he made this explanation
he felt its weakness. To begin with, the desk
was too high for a boy. The improbability that
any boy would place a book there was equalled
by the improbability that he would leave it
there. To discover its uninviting character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
would be the work only of a moment, and no
boy would have brought it so far from its shelf.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel had, however, come to read,
and habit was too strong with him to be wholly
set aside. Leaving &ldquo;The Compleat Gard&rsquo;ner&rdquo;
on the desk, he turned round to the shelves
to find some more congenial reading.</p>

<p>Hardly had he done this when he was
startled by a sharp rap upon the desk behind
him, followed by a rustling of paper. He
turned quickly about and saw the quarto lying
open. In obedience to the instinct of the
moment, he at once sought a natural cause
for what he saw. Only a wind, and that of
the strongest, could have opened the book, and
laid back its heavy cover; and though he
accepted, for a brief moment, that explanation,
he was too candid to retain it longer. The
wind out of doors was very light. The window
sash was closed and latched, and, to decide
the matter finally, the book had its back, and
not its edges, turned towards the only quarter
from which a wind could strike.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel approached the desk again and
stood over the book. With increasing perturbation
of mind (for he still thought of the
matchbox) he looked upon the open page.
Without much reason beyond that he felt
constrained to do something, he read the words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of the half completed sentence at the turn of
the page&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquo1">
<p class="noi">&ldquo;at dead of night he left the house and
passed into the solitude of the garden.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">But he read no more, nor did he give himself
the trouble of discovering whose midnight
wandering was being described, although the
habit was singularly like one of his own. He
was in no condition for reading, and turning his
back upon the volume he slowly paced the
length of the chamber, &ldquo;wondering at that
which had come to pass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He reached the opposite end of the chamber
and was in the act of turning, when again he
heard the rustling of paper, and by the time he
had faced round, saw the leaves of the book
again turning over. In a moment the volume
lay at rest, open in another place, and there was
no further movement as he approached it. To
make sure that he had not been deceived, he
read again the words as they entered the page.
The author was following a not uncommon
practise of the time, and throwing common
speech into forms suggested by Holy Writ:
&ldquo;So dig,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;that ye may obtain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This passage, which to Mr. Batchel seemed
reprehensible in its levity, excited at once his
interest and his disapproval. He was prepared
to read more, but this time was not allowed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Before his eye could pass beyond the passage
already cited, the leaves of the book slowly
turned again, and presented but a termination
of five words and a colophon.</p>

<p>The words were, &ldquo;to the North, an Ilex.&rdquo;
These three passages, in which he saw no meaning
and no connection, began to entangle
themselves together in Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s mind. He
found himself repeating them in different orders,
now beginning with one, and now with another.
Any further attempt at reading he felt to be
impossible, and he was in no mind for any more
experiences of the unaccountable. Sleep was, of
course, further from him than ever, if that were
conceivable. What he did, therefore, was to
blow out the candle, to return to his moonlit
bedroom, and put on more clothing, and then to
pass downstairs with the object of going out of
doors.</p>

<p>It was not unusual with Mr. Batchel to walk
about his garden at night-time. This form of
exercise had often, after a wakeful hour, sent
him back to his bed refreshed and ready for
sleep. The convenient access to the garden at
such times lay through his study, whose French
windows opened on to a short flight of steps,
and upon these he now paused for a moment to
admire the snow-like appearance of the lawns,
bathed as they were in the moonlight. As he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
paused, he heard the city clocks strike the half-hour
after midnight, and he could not forbear
repeating aloud</p>

<div class="blockquo1">
<p class="noi">&ldquo;At dead of night he left the house, and
passed into the solitude of the garden.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">It was solitary enough. At intervals the screech
of an owl, and now and then the noise of a train,
seemed to emphasise the solitude by drawing
attention to it and then leaving it in possession
of the night. Mr. Batchel found himself
wondering and conjecturing what Vicar Whitehead,
who had acquired the close of land to
secure quiet and privacy for garden, would have
thought of the railways to the west and north.
He turned his face northwards, whence a whistle
had just sounded, and saw a tree beautifully
outlined against the sky. His breath caught at
the sight. Not because the tree was unfamiliar.
Mr. Batchel knew all his trees. But what he
had seen was &ldquo;to the north, an Ilex.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel knew not what to make of it
all. He had walked into the garden hundreds
of times and as often seen the Ilex, but the
words out of the &ldquo;Compleat Gard&rsquo;ner&rdquo; seemed
to be pursuing him in a way that made him
almost afraid. His temperament, however, as
has been said already, was phlegmatic. It was
commonly said, and Mr. Batchel approved the
verdict, whilst he condemned its inexactness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
that &ldquo;his nerves were made of fiddle-string,&rdquo; so
he braced himself afresh and set upon his
walk round the silent garden, which he was
accustomed to begin in a northerly direction,
and was now too proud to change. He usually
passed the Ilex at the beginning of his perambulation,
and so would pass it now.</p>

<p>He did not pass it. A small discovery, as
he reached it, annoyed and disturbed him. His
gardener, as careful and punctilious as himself,
never failed to house all his tools at the end of a
day&rsquo;s work. Yet there, under the Ilex, standing
upright in moonlight brilliant enough to cast
a shadow of it, was a spade.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s second thought was one of
relief. After his extraordinary experiences in the
library (he hardly knew now whether they had
been real or not) something quite commonplace
would act sedatively, and he determined to
carry the spade to the tool-house.</p>

<p>The soil was quite dry, and the surface
even a little frozen, so Mr. Batchel left the path,
walked up to the spade, and would have drawn
it towards him. But it was as if he had made
the attempt upon the trunk of the Ilex itself.
The spade would not be moved. Then, first
with one hand, and then with both, he tried
to raise it, and still it stood firm. Mr. Batchel,
of course, attributed this to the frost, slight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
as it was. Wondering at the spade&rsquo;s being
there, and annoyed at its being frozen, he was
about to leave it and continue his walk, when
the remaining words of the &ldquo;Compleat
Gard&rsquo;ner&rdquo; seemed rather to utter themselves,
than to await his will&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquo2">
<p class="noi">&ldquo;So dig, that ye may obtain.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s power of independent action now
deserted him. He took the spade, which no
longer resisted, and began to dig. &ldquo;Five spadefuls
and no more,&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;This is all
foolishness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Four spadefuls of earth he then raised and
spread out before him in the moonlight. There
was nothing unusual to be seen. Nor did Mr.
Batchel decide what he would look for, whether
coins, jewels, documents in canisters, or
weapons. In point of fact, he dug against what
he deemed his better judgment, and expected
nothing. He spread before him the fifth and last
spadeful of earth, not quite without result, but
with no result that was at all sensational. The
earth contained a bone. Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s knowledge
of anatomy was sufficient to show him
that it was a human bone. He identified it,
even by moonlight, as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">radius</i>, a bone of the
forearm, as he removed the earth from it, with
his thumb.</p>

<p>Such a discovery might be thought worthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of more than the very ordinary interest Mr.
Batchel showed. As a matter of fact, the
presence of a human bone was easily to be
accounted for. Recent excavations within the
church had caused the upturning of numberless
bones, which had been collected and reverently
buried. But an earth-stained bone is also
easily overlooked, and this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">radius</i> had obviously
found its way into the garden with some of
the earth brought out of the church.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel was glad, rather than regretful
at this termination to his adventure. He was
once more provided with something to do.
The re-interment of such bones as this had
been his constant care, and he decided at once
to restore the bone to consecrated earth. The
time seemed opportune. The eyes of the
curious were closed in sleep, he himself was
still alert and wakeful. The spade remained
by his side and the bone in his hand. So he
betook himself, there and then, to the churchyard.
By the still generous light of the moon,
he found a place where the earth yielded to
his spade, and within a few minutes the bone
was laid decently to earth, some 18 inches deep.</p>

<p>The city clocks struck one as he finished.
The whole world seemed asleep, and Mr. Batchel
slowly returned to the garden with his spade.
As he hung it in its accustomed place he felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
stealing over him the welcome desire to sleep.
He walked quietly on to the house and ascended
to his room. It was now dark: the moon had
passed on and left the room in shadow. He lit
a candle, and before undressing passed into the
library. He had an irresistible curiosity to see
the passages in John Evelyn&rsquo;s book which
had so strangely adapted themselves to the
events of the past hour.</p>

<p>In the library a last surprise awaited him.
The desk upon which the book had lain was
empty. &ldquo;The Compleat Gard&rsquo;ner&rdquo; stood in
its place on the shelf. And then Mr. Batchel
knew that he had handled a bone of William
Whitehead, and that in response to his own
entreaty.</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III.<br />

<span class="stl">THE RICHPINS.</span></h2>


<p>Something of the general character of
Stoneground and its people has been indicated
by stray allusions in the preceding narratives.
We must here add that of its present population
only a small part is native, the remainder
having been attracted during the recent prosperous
days of brickmaking, from the nearer
parts of East Anglia and the Midlands. The
visitor to Stoneground now finds little more
than the signs of an unlovely industry, and of
the hasty and inadequate housing of the people
it has drawn together. Nothing in the place
pleases him more than the excellent train-service
which makes it easy to get away. He
seldom desires a long acquaintance either with
Stoneground or its people.</p>

<p>The impression so made upon the average
visitor is, however, unjust, as first impressions
often are. The few who have made further
acquaintance with Stoneground have soon
learned to distinguish between the permanent
and the accidental features of the place, and
have been astonished by nothing so much as by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the unexpected evidence of French influence.
Amongst the household treasures of the old
inhabitants are invariably found French knick-knacks:
there are pieces of French furniture in
what is called &ldquo;the room&rdquo; of many houses. A
certain ten-acre field is called the &ldquo;Frenchman&rsquo;s
meadow.&rdquo; Upon the voters&rsquo; lists hanging at the
church door are to be found French names,
often corrupted; and boys who run about the
streets can be heard shrieking to each other
such names as Bunnum, Dangibow, Planchey,
and so on.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel himself is possessed of many
curious little articles of French handiwork&mdash;boxes
deftly covered with split straws, arranged
ingeniously in patterns; models of the guillotine,
built of carved meat-bones, and various
other pieces of handiwork, amongst them an
accurate road-map of the country between
Stoneground and Yarmouth, drawn upon a fly-leaf
torn from some book, and bearing upon the
other side the name of Jules Richepin. The
latter had been picked up, according to a
pencilled-note written across one corner, by a
shepherd, in the year 1811.</p>

<p>The explanation of this French influence is
simple enough. Within five miles of Stoneground
a large barracks had been erected for
the custody of French prisoners during the war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
with Bonaparte. Many thousands were confined
there during the years 1808-14. The prisoners
were allowed to sell what articles they could
make in the barracks; and many of them, upon
their release, settled in the neighbourhood,
where their descendants remain. There is little
curiosity amongst these descendants about their
origin. The events of a century ago seem to
them as remote as the Deluge, and as immaterial.
To Thomas Richpin, a weakly man
who blew the organ in church, Mr. Batchel
shewed the map. Richpin, with a broad, black-haired
skull and a narrow chin which grew a
little pointed beard, had always a foreign look
about him: Mr. Batchel thought it more than
possible that he might be descended from the
owner of the book, and told him as much upon
shewing him the fly-leaf. Thomas, however,
was content to observe that &ldquo;his name hadn&rsquo;t
got no E,&rdquo; and shewed no further interest in the
matter. His interest in it, before we have done
with him, will have become very large.</p>

<p>For the growing boys of Stoneground, with
whom he was on generally friendly terms, Mr.
Batchel formed certain clubs to provide them
with occupation on winter evenings; and in
these clubs, in the interests of peace and good-order,
he spent a great deal of time. Sitting
one December evening, in a large circle of boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
who preferred the warmth of the fire to the
more temperate atmosphere of the tables, he
found Thomas Richpin the sole topic of conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We seen Mr. Richpin in Frenchman&rsquo;s
Meadow last night,&rdquo; said one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What time?&rdquo; said Mr. Batchel, whose
function it was to act as a sort of fly-wheel, and
to carry the conversation over dead points. He
had received the information with some little
surprise, because Frenchman&rsquo;s Meadow was an
unusual place for Richpin to have been in, but
his question had no further object than to
encourage talk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Half-past nine,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>

<p>This made the question much more interesting.
Mr. Batchel, on the preceding evening,
had taken advantage of a warmed church to
practise upon the organ. He had played it from
nine o&rsquo;clock until ten, and Richpin had been all
that time at the bellows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure it was half-past nine?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; (we reproduce the answer exactly),
&ldquo;we come out o&rsquo; night-school at quarter-past,
and we was all goin&rsquo; to the Wash to look if it
was friz.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you saw Mr. Richpin in Frenchman&rsquo;s
Meadow?&rdquo; said Mr. Batchel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. He was looking for something on the
ground,&rdquo; added another boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And his trousers was tore,&rdquo; said a third.</p>

<p>The story was clearly destined to stand in
no need of corroboration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Mr. Richpin speak to you?&rdquo; enquired
Mr. Batchel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we run away afore he come to us,&rdquo; was
the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because we was frit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What frightened you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim Lallement hauled a flint at him and
hit him in the face, and he didn&rsquo;t take no notice,
so we run away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Batchel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because he never hollered nor looked at us,
and it made us feel so funny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you go straight down to the Wash?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had all done so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What time was it when you reached
home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had all been at home by ten, before
Richpin had left the church.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do they call it Frenchman&rsquo;s
Meadow?&rdquo; asked another boy, evidently
anxious to change the subject.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel replied that the meadow had
probably belonged to a Frenchman whose name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
was not easy to say, and the conversation after
this was soon in another channel. But, furnished
as he was with an unmistakeable <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alibi</i>,
the story about Richpin and the torn trousers,
and the flint, greatly puzzled him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go straight home,&rdquo; he said, as the boys at
last bade him good-night, &ldquo;and let us have no
more stone-throwing.&rdquo; They were reckless
boys, and Richpin, who used little discretion
in reporting their misdemeanours about the
church, seemed to Mr. Batchel to stand in real
danger.</p>

<p>Frenchman&rsquo;s Meadow provided ten acres of
excellent pasture, and the owners of two or
three hard-worked horses were glad to pay three
shillings a week for the privilege of turning
them into it. One of these men came to Mr.
Batchel on the morning which followed the
conversation at the club.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a bit of a quandary about Tom
Richpin,&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>This was an opening that did not fail to
command Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s attention. &ldquo;What is
it?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had my mare in Frenchman&rsquo;s Meadow,&rdquo;
replied the man, &ldquo;and Sam Bower come and
told me last night as he heard her gallopin&rsquo;
about when he was walking this side the
hedge.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But what about Richpin?&rdquo; said Mr.
Batchel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me come to it,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;My
mare hasn&rsquo;t got no wind to gallop, so I up and
went to see to her, and there she was sure
enough, like a wild thing, and Tom Richpin
walking across the meadow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was he chasing her?&rdquo; asked Mr. Batchel,
who felt the absurdity of the question as he
put it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was not,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;but what he
could have been doin&rsquo; to put the mare into that
state, I can&rsquo;t think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was he doing when you saw him?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Batchel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was walking along looking for something
he&rsquo;d dropped, with his trousers all tore to
ribbons, and while I was catchin&rsquo; the mare, he
made off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was easy enough to find, I suppose?&rdquo;
said Mr. Batchel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the quandary I was put in,&rdquo; said
the man. &ldquo;I took the mare home and gave her
to my lad, and straight I went to Richpin&rsquo;s, and
found Tom havin&rsquo; his supper, with his trousers
as good as new.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d made a mistake,&rdquo; said Mr. Batchel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how come the mare to make it too?&rdquo;
said the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say to Richpin?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Batchel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;when did you come in?
&lsquo;Six o&rsquo;clock,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;I bin mendin&rsquo; my boots&rsquo;;
and there, sure enough, was the hobbin&rsquo; iron by
his chair, and him in his stockin&rsquo;-feet. I don&rsquo;t
know what to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give the mare a rest,&rdquo; said Mr. Batchel,
&ldquo;and say no more about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to harm a pore creature like
Richpin,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;but a mare&rsquo;s a mare,
especially where there&rsquo;s a family to bring up.&rdquo;
The man consented, however, to abide by Mr.
Batchel&rsquo;s advice, and the interview ended. The
evenings just then were light, and both the
man and his mare had seen something for
which Mr. Batchel could not, at present,
account. The worst way, however, of arriving
at an explanation is to guess it. He was far too
wise to let himself wander into the pleasant
fields of conjecture, and had determined, even
before the story of the mare had finished, upon
the more prosaic path of investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel, either from strength or
indolence of mind, as the reader may be pleased
to determine, did not allow matters even of this
exciting kind, to disturb his daily round of duty.
He was beginning to fear, after what he had
heard of the Frenchman&rsquo;s Meadow, that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
might find it necessary to preach a plain
sermon upon the Witch of Endor, for he
foresaw that there would soon be some ghostly
talk in circulation. In small communities, like
that of Stoneground, such talk arises upon very
slight provocation, and here was nothing at all
to check it. Richpin was a weak and timid
man, whom no one would suspect, whilst an
alternative remained open, of wandering about
in the dark; and Mr. Batchel knew that the
alternative of an apparition, if once suggested,
would meet with general acceptance, and this he
wished, at all costs, to avoid. His own view of
the matter he held in reserve, for the reasons
already stated, but he could not help suspecting
that there might be a better explanation of the
name &ldquo;Frenchman&rsquo;s Meadow&rdquo; than he had
given to the boys at their club.</p>

<p>Afternoons, with Mr. Batchel, were always
spent in making pastoral visits, and upon the
day our story has reached he determined to
include amongst them a call upon Richpin, and
to submit him to a cautious cross-examination.
It was evident that at least four persons, all
perfectly familiar with his appearance, were
under the impression that they had seen him in
the meadow, and his own statement upon the
matter would be at least worth hearing.</p>

<p>Richpin&rsquo;s home, however, was not the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
one visited by Mr. Batchel on that afternoon.
His friendly relations with the boys has already
been mentioned, and it may now be added that
this friendship was but part of a generally keen
sympathy with young people of all ages, and of
both sexes. Parents knew much less than he
did of the love affairs of their young people;
and if he was not actually guilty of match-making,
he was at least a very sympathetic
observer of the process. When lovers had their
little differences, or even their greater ones, it
was Mr. Batchel, in most cases, who adjusted
them, and who suffered, if he failed, hardly less
than the lovers themselves.</p>

<p>It was a negotiation of this kind which, on
this particular day, had given precedence to
another visit, and left Richpin until the later
part of the afternoon. But the matter of the
Frenchman&rsquo;s Meadow had, after all, not to wait
for Richpin. Mr. Batchel was calculating how
long he should be in reaching it, when he found
himself unexpectedly there. Selina Broughton
had been a favourite of his from her childhood;
she had been sufficiently good to please him, and
naughty enough to attract and challenge him;
and when at length she began to walk out with
Bob Rockfort, who was another favourite, Mr.
Batchel rubbed his hands in satisfaction. Their
present difference, which now brought him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the Broughtons&rsquo; cottage, gave him but little
anxiety. He had brought Bob half-way towards
reconciliation, and had no doubt of his ability
to lead Selina to the same place. They would
finish the journey, happily enough, together.</p>

<p>But what has this to do with the Frenchman&rsquo;s
Meadow? Much every way. The meadow
was apt to be the rendezvous of such young
people as desired a higher degree of privacy than
that afforded by the public paths; and these two
had gone there separately the night before, each
to nurse a grievance against the other. They
had been at opposite ends, as it chanced, of the
field; and Bob, who believed himself to be alone
there, had been awakened from his reverie by a
sudden scream. He had at once run across the
field, and found Selina sorely in need of him.
Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s work of reconciliation had been
there and then anticipated, and Bob had taken
the girl home in a condition of great excitement
to her mother. All this was explained, in
breathless sentences, by Mrs. Broughton, by
way of accounting for the fact that Selina was
then lying down in &ldquo;the room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no reason why Mr. Batchel should
not see her, of course, and he went in. His
original errand had lapsed, but it was now replaced
by one of greater interest. Evidently
there was Selina&rsquo;s testimony to add to that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the other four; she was not a girl who would
scream without good cause, and Mr. Batchel felt
that he knew how his question about the cause
would be answered, when he came to the point
of asking it.</p>

<p>He was not quite prepared for the form of
her answer, which she gave without any hesitation.
She had seen Mr. Richpin &ldquo;looking for
his eyes.&rdquo; Mr. Batchel saved for another occasion
the amusement to be derived from the
curiously illogical answer. He saw at once
what had suggested it. Richpin had until
recently had an atrocious squint, which an
operation in London had completely cured.
This operation, of which, of course, he knew
nothing, he had described, in his own way,
to anyone who would listen, and it was
commonly believed that his eyes had ceased
to be fixtures. It was plain, however, that
Selina had seen very much what had been
seen by the other four. Her information
was precise, and her story perfectly coherent.
She preserved a maidenly reticence about
his trousers, if she had noticed them; but
added a new fact, and a terrible one, in her
description of the eyeless sockets. No wonder
she had screamed. It will be observed that Mr.
Richpin was still searching, if not looking, for
something upon the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Batchel now proceeded to make his remaining
visit. Richpin lived in a little cottage
by the church, of which cottage the Vicar was
the indulgent landlord. Richpin&rsquo;s creditors
were obliged to shew some indulgence, because
his income was never regular and seldom sufficient.
He got on in life by what is called
&ldquo;rubbing along,&rdquo; and appeared to do it with
surprisingly little friction. The small duties
about the church, assigned to him out of charity,
were overpaid. He succeeded in attracting to
himself all the available gifts of masculine
clothing, of which he probably received enough
and to sell, and he had somehow wooed and won
a capable, if not very comely, wife, who supplemented
his income by her own labour, and
managed her house and husband to admiration.</p>

<p>Richpin, however, was not by any means
a mere dependent upon charity. He was, in his
way, a man of parts. All plants, for instance,
were his friends, and he had inherited, or
acquired, great skill with fruit-trees, which never
failed to reward his treatment with abundant
crops. The two or three vines, too, of the
neighbourhood, he kept in fine order by methods
of his own, whose merit was proved by their
success. He had other skill, though of a less
remunerative kind, in fashioning toys out of
wood, cardboard, or paper; and every correctly-behaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
child in the parish had some such
product of his handiwork. And besides all this,
Richpin had a remarkable aptitude for making
music. He could do something upon every
musical instrument that came in his way, and,
but for his voice, which was like that of the peahen,
would have been a singer. It was his voice
that had secured him the situation of organ-blower,
as one remote from all incitement to
join in the singing in church.</p>

<p>Like all men who have not wit enough to
defend themselves by argument, Richpin had
a plaintive manner. His way of resenting
injury was to complain of it to the next person
he met, and such complaints as he found no
other means of discharging, he carried home
to his wife, who treated his conversation just as
she treated the singing of the canary, and other
domestic sounds, being hardly conscious of it
until it ceased.</p>

<p>The entrance of Mr. Batchel, soon after his
interview with Selina, found Richpin engaged
in a loud and fluent oration. The fluency was
achieved mainly by repetition, for the man had
but small command of words, but it served
none the less to shew the depth of his indignation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I aren&rsquo;t bin in Frenchman&rsquo;s Meadow, am
I?&rdquo; he was saying in appeal to his wife&mdash;this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the Stoneground way with auxiliary verbs&mdash;&ldquo;What
am I got to go there for?&rdquo; He acknowledged
Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s entrance in no other way
than by changing to the third person in his
discourse, and he continued without pause&mdash;&ldquo;if
she&rsquo;d let me out o&rsquo; nights, I&rsquo;m got better
places to go to than Frenchman&rsquo;s Meadow.
Let policeman stick to where I am bin, or else
keep his mouth shut. What call is he got to
say I&rsquo;m bin where I aren&rsquo;t bin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>From this, and much more to the same
effect, it was clear that the matter of the
meadow was being noised abroad, and even
receiving official attention. Mr. Batchel was
well aware that no question he could put to
Richpin, in his present state, would change the
flow of his eloquence, and that he had already
learned as much as he was likely to learn. He
was content, therefore, to ascertain from Mrs.
Richpin that her husband had indeed spent all
his evenings at home, with the single exception
of the one hour during which Mr. Batchel had
employed him at the organ. Having ascertained
this, he retired, and left Richpin to talk himself
out.</p>

<p>No further doubt about the story was now
possible. It was not twenty-four hours since
Mr. Batchel had heard it from the boys at the
club, and it had already been confirmed by at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
least two unimpeachable witnesses. He thought
the matter over, as he took his tea, and was
chiefly concerned in Richpin&rsquo;s curious connexion
with it. On his account, more than on
any other, it had become necessary to make
whatever investigation might be feasible, and
Mr. Batchel determined, of course, to make the
next stage of it in the meadow itself.</p>

<p>The situation of &ldquo;Frenchman&rsquo;s Meadow&rdquo;
made it more conspicuous than any other enclosure
in the neighbourhood. It was upon the
edge of what is locally known as &ldquo;high land&rdquo;;
and though its elevation was not great, one
could stand in the meadow and look sea-wards
over many miles of flat country, once a waste
of brackish water, now a great chess-board of
fertile fields bounded by straight dykes of
glistening water. The point of view derived
another interest from looking down upon a
long straight bank which disappeared into the
horizon many miles away, and might have been
taken for a great railway embankment of which
no use had been made. It was, in fact, one of
the great works of the Dutch Engineers in the
time of Charles&nbsp;<abbr title="1">I.</abbr>, and it separated the river
basin from a large drained area called the
&ldquo;Middle Level,&rdquo; some six feet below it. In this
embankment, not two hundred yards below
&ldquo;Frenchman&rsquo;s Meadow,&rdquo; was one of the huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
water gates which admitted traffic through a
sluice, into the lower level, and the picturesque
thatched cottage of the sluice-keeper formed a
pleasing addition to the landscape. It was a
view with which Mr. Batchel was naturally
very familiar. Few of his surroundings were
pleasant to the eye, and this was about the only
place to which he could take a visitor whom he
desired to impress favourably. The way to the
meadow lay through a short lane, and he could
reach it in five minutes: he was frequently
there.</p>

<p>It was, of course, his intention to be there
again that evening: to spend the night there, if
need be, rather than let anything escape him.
He only hoped he should not find half the
parish there also. His best hope of privacy lay
in the inclemency of the weather; the day was
growing colder, and there was a north-east
wind, of which Frenchman&rsquo;s Meadow would
receive the fine edge.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel spent the next three hours in
dealing with some arrears of correspondence,
and at nine o&rsquo;clock put on his thickest coat and
boots, and made his way to the meadow. It
became evident, as he walked up the lane, that
he was to have company. He heard many
voices, and soon recognised the loudest amongst
them. Jim Lallement was boasting of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
accuracy of his aim: the others were not disputing
it, but were asserting their own merits
in discordant chorus. This was a nuisance, and
to make matters worse, Mr. Batchel heard steps
behind him.</p>

<p>A voice soon bade him &ldquo;Good evening.&rdquo; To
Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s great relief it proved to be the
policeman, who soon overtook him. The conversation
began on his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Curious tricks, sir, these of Richpin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What tricks?&rdquo; asked Mr. Batchel, with an
air of innocence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s been walking about Frenchman&rsquo;s
Meadow these three nights, frightening
folk and what all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Richpin has been at home every night, and
all night long,&rdquo; said Mr. Batchel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking about where he was, not where
he says he was,&rdquo; said the policeman. &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t go behind the evidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Richpin has evidence too. I asked his
wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, sir, and none better, that wives
have got to obey. Richpin wants to be took for
a ghost, and we know that sort of ghost. Whenever
we hear there&rsquo;s a ghost, we always know
there&rsquo;s going to be turkeys missing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there are real ghosts sometimes,
surely?&rdquo; said Mr. Batchel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the policeman, &ldquo;me and my
wife have both looked, and there&rsquo;s no such
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looked where?&rdquo; enquired Mr. Batchel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the &lsquo;Police Duty&rsquo; Catechism. There&rsquo;s
lunatics, and deserters, and dead bodies, but no
ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel accepted this as final. He had
devised a way of ridding himself of all his
company, and proceeded at once to carry it into
effect. The two had by this time reached the
group of boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are all stone-throwers,&rdquo; said he,
loudly.</p>

<p>There was a clatter of stones as they
dropped from the hands of the boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These boys ought all to be in the club
instead of roaming about here damaging property.
Will you take them there, and see them
safely in? If Richpin comes here, I will bring
him to the station.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The policeman seemed well pleased with
the suggestion. No doubt he had overstated his
confidence in the definition of the &ldquo;Police
Duty.&rdquo; Mr. Batchel, on his part, knew the boys
well enough to be assured that they would keep
the policeman occupied for the next half-hour,
and as the party moved slowly away, felt proud
of his diplomacy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no sign of any other person
about the field gate, which he climbed readily
enough, and he was soon standing in the
highest part of the meadow and peering into
the darkness on every side.</p>

<p>It was possible to see a distance of about
thirty yards; beyond that it was too dark to distinguish
anything. Mr. Batchel designed a zig-zag
course about the meadow, which would
allow of his examining it systematically and as
rapidly as possible, and along this course he
began to walk briskly, looking straight before
him as he went, and pausing to look well about
him when he came to a turn. There were no
beasts in the meadow&mdash;their owners had taken
the precaution of removing them; their absence
was, of course, of great advantage to Mr.
Batchel.</p>

<p>In about ten minutes he had finished his
zig-zag path and arrived at the other corner of
the meadow; he had seen nothing resembling a
man. He then retraced his steps, and examined
the field again, but arrived at his starting
point, knowing no more than when he had left
it. He began to fear the return of the policeman
as he faced the wind and set upon a third
journey.</p>

<p>The third journey, however, rewarded him.
He had reached the end of his second traverse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and was looking about him at the angle
between that and the next, when he distinctly
saw what looked like Richpin crossing his circle
of vision, and making straight for the sluice.
There was no gate on that side of the field; the
hedge, which seemed to present no obstacle to
the other, delayed Mr. Batchel considerably, and
still retains some of his clothing, but he was not
long through before he had again marked his
man. It had every appearance of being Richpin.
It went down the slope, crossed the plank
that bridged the lock, and disappeared round
the corner of the cottage, where the entrance
lay.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel had had no opportunity of confirming
the gruesome observation of Selina
Broughton, but had seen enough to prove that
the others had not been romancing. He was not
a half-minute behind the figure as it crossed the
plank over the lock&mdash;it was slow going in the
darkness&mdash;and he followed it immediately round
the corner of the house. As he expected, it
had then disappeared.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel knocked at the door, and admitted
himself, as his custom was. The sluice-keeper
was in his kitchen, charring a gate post.
He was surprised to see Mr. Batchel at that
hour, and his greeting took the form of a
remark to that effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been taking an evening walk,&rdquo; said
Mr. Batchel. &ldquo;Have you seen Richpin lately?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see him last Saturday week,&rdquo; replied the
sluice-keeper, &ldquo;not since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you feel lonely here at night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the sluice-keeper, &ldquo;people
drop in at times. There was a man in on
Monday, and another yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you had no one to-day?&rdquo; said Mr.
Batchel, coming to the point.</p>

<p>The answer showed that Mr. Batchel had
been the first to enter the door that day, and
after a little general conversation he brought
his visit to an end.</p>

<p>It was now ten o&rsquo;clock. He looked in at
Richpin&rsquo;s cottage, where he saw a light
burning, as he passed. Richpin had tired himself
early, and had been in bed since half-past
eight. His wife was visibly annoyed at the
rumours which had upset him, and Mr. Batchel
said such soothing words as he could command,
before he left for home.</p>

<p>He congratulated himself, prematurely, as
he sat before the fire in his study, that the day
was at an end. It had been cold out of doors,
and it was pleasant to think things over in the
warmth of the cheerful fire his housekeeper
never failed to leave for him. The reader will
have no more difficulty than Mr. Batchel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
had in accounting for the resemblance between
Richpin and the man in the meadow. It was a
mere question of family likeness. That the
ancestor had been seen in the meadow at some
former time might perhaps be inferred from its
traditional name. The reason for his return,
then and now, was a matter of mere conjecture,
and Mr. Batchel let it alone.</p>

<p>The next incident has, to some, appeared
incredible, which only means, after all, that it
has made demands upon their powers of
imagination and found them bankrupt.</p>

<p>Critics of story-telling have used severe
language about authors who avail themselves
of the short-cut of coincidence. &ldquo;That must be
reserved, I suppose,&rdquo; said Mr. Batchel, when he
came to tell of Richpin, &ldquo;for what really
happens; and that fiction is a game which must
be played according to the rules.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he went on to say, &ldquo;that the
chances were some millions to one against
what happened that night, but if that makes it
incredible, what is there left to believe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was thereupon remarked by someone in
the company, that the credible material would
not be exhausted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt whether anything happens,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Batchel in his dogmatic way,
&ldquo;without the chances being a million to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
against it. Why did they choose such a word?
What does &lsquo;happen&rsquo; mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no reply: it was clearly a
rhetorical question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it incredible,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that I put
into the plate last Sunday the very half-crown
my uncle tipped me with in 1881, and that I
spent next day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was that the one you put in?&rdquo; was asked
by several.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo; replied Mr. Batchel,
&ldquo;but if I knew the history of the half-crown I
did put in, I know it would furnish still more
remarkable coincidences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this talk arose out of the fact that at
midnight on the eventful day, whilst Mr.
Batchel was still sitting by his study fire, he
had news that the cottage at the sluice had
been burnt down. The thatch had been dry;
there was, as we know, a stiff east-wind, and an
hour had sufficed to destroy all that was
inflammable. The fire is still spoken of in
Stoneground with great regret. There remains
only one building in the place of sufficient
merit to find its way on to a postcard.</p>

<p>It was just at midnight that the sluice-keeper
rung at Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s door. His errand
required no apology. The man had found a
night-fisherman to help him as soon as the fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
began, and with two long sprits from a lighter
they had made haste to tear down the thatch,
and upon this had brought down, from under
the ridge at the South end, the bones and some
of the clothing of a man. Would Mr. Batchel
come down and see?</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel put on his coat and returned
to the place. The people whom the fire had
collected had been kept on the further side of
the water, and the space about the cottage was
vacant. Near to the smouldering heap of ruin
were the remains found under the thatch. The
fingers of the right hand still firmly clutched a
sheep bone which had been gnawed as a dog
would gnaw it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Starved to death,&rdquo; said the sluice-keeper,
&ldquo;I see a tramp like that ten years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They laid the bones decently in an outhouse,
and turned the key, Mr. Batchel
carried home in his hand a metal cross, threaded
upon a cord. He found an engraved figure of
Our Lord on the face of it, and the name of
Pierre Richepin upon the back. He went next
day to make the matter known to the nearest
Priest of the Roman Faith, with whom he left
the cross. The remains, after a brief inquest,
were interred in the cemetery, with the rites of
the Church to which the man had evidently
belonged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s deductions from the whole
circumstances were curious, and left a great
deal to be explained. It seemed as if Pierre
Richepin had been disturbed by some premonition
of the fire, but had not foreseen that
his mortal remains would escape; that he could
not return to his own people without the aid of
his map, but had no perception of the interval
that had elapsed since he had lost it. This map
Mr. Batchel put into his pocket-book next day
when he went to Thomas Richpin for certain
other information about his surviving relatives.</p>

<p>Richpin had a father, it appeared, living a
few miles away in Jakesley Fen, and Mr.
Batchel concluded that he was worth a visit.
He mounted his bicycle, therefore, and made his
way to Jakesley that same afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. Richpin was working not far from
home, and was soon brought in. He and his
wife shewed great courtesy to their visitor,
whom they knew well by repute. They had
a well-ordered house, and with a natural and
dignified hospitality, asked him to take tea with
them. It was evident to Mr. Batchel that there
was a great gulf between the elder Richpin and
his son; the former was the last of an old race,
and the latter the first of a new. In spite of
the Board of Education, the latter was vastly
the worse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The cottage contained some French kickshaws
which greatly facilitated the enquiries
Mr. Batchel had come to make. They proved
to be family relics.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My grandfather,&rdquo; said Mr. Richpin, as they
sat at tea, &ldquo;was a prisoner&mdash;he and his brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your grandfather was Pierre Richepin?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Batchel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! Jules,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Pierre got
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shew Mr. Batchel the book,&rdquo; said his wife.</p>

<p>The book was produced. It was a Book of
Meditations, with the name of Jules Richepin
upon the title-page. The fly-leaf was missing.
Mr. Batchel produced the map from his pocket-book.
It fitted exactly. The slight indentures
along the torn edge fell into their place, and
Mr. Batchel left the leaf in the book, to the
great delight of the old couple, to whom he
told no more of the story than he thought fit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a><br /><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV.<br />

<span class="stl">THE EASTERN WINDOW.</span></h2>


<p>It may well be that Vermuyden and the
Dutchmen who drained the fens did good, and
that it was interred with their bones. It is
quite certain that they did evil and that it lives
after them. The rivers, which these men
robbed of their water, have at length silted up,
and the drainage of one tract of country is
proving to have been achieved by the undraining
of another.</p>

<p>Places like Stoneground, which lie on the
banks of these defrauded rivers, are now become
helpless victims of Dutch engineering.
The water which has lost its natural outlet,
invades their lands. The thrifty cottager who
once had the river at the bottom of his garden,
has his garden more often in these days, at the
bottom of the river, and a summer flood not
infrequently destroys the whole produce of his
ground.</p>

<p>Such a flood, during an early year in the
20th century, had been unusually disastrous
to Stoneground, and Mr. Batchel, who, as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
gardener, was well able to estimate the losses of
his poorer neighbours, was taking some steps
towards repairing them.</p>

<p>Money, however, is never at rest in Stoneground,
and it turned out upon this occasion
that the funds placed at his command were
wholly inadequate to the charitable purpose
assigned to them. It seemed as if those who
had lost a rood of potatoes could be compensated
for no more than a yard.</p>

<p>It was at this time, when he was oppressed
in mind by the failure of his charitable enterprise,
that Mr. Batchel met with the happy
adventure in which the Eastern window of the
Church played so singular a part.</p>

<p>The narrative should be prefaced by a brief
description of the window in question. It is a
large painted window, of a somewhat unfortunate
period of execution. The drawing and
colouring leave everything to be desired. The
scheme of the window, however, is based upon
a wholesome tradition. The five large lights in
the lower part are assigned to five scenes in the
life of Our Lord, and the second of these,
counting from the North, contains a bold
erect figure of St. John Baptist, to whom the
Church is dedicated. It is this figure alone, of
all those contained in the window, that is concerned
in what we have to relate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>It has already been mentioned that Mr.
Batchel had some knowledge of music. He took
an interest in the choir, from whose practices
he was seldom absent; and was quite competent,
in the occasional absence of the choirmaster, to
act as his deputy. It is customary at Stoneground
for the choirmaster, in order to save the
sexton a journey, to extinguish the lights after
a choir-practice and to lock up the Church.
These duties, accordingly, were performed by
Mr. Batchel when the need arose.</p>

<p>It will be of use to the reader to have the
procedure in detail. The large gas-meter stood
in an aisle of the Church, and it was Mr.
Batchel&rsquo;s practice to go round and extinguish
all the lights save one, before turning off the
gas at the meter. The one remaining light,
which was reached by standing upon a choir
seat, was always that nearest the door of the
chancel, and experience proved that there was
ample time to walk from the meter to that light
before it died out. It was therefore an easy
matter to turn off the last light, to find the door
without its aid, and thence to pass out, and
close the Church for the night.</p>

<p>Upon the evening of which we have to speak,
the choir had hurried out as usual, as soon
as the word had been given. Mr. Batchel had
remained to gather together some of the books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
they had left in disorder, and then turned out
the lights in the manner already described. But
as soon as he had extinguished the last light, his
eye fell, as he descended carefully from the seat,
upon the figure of the Baptist. There was just
enough light outside to make the figures visible
in the Eastern Window, and Mr. Batchel saw
the figure of St. John raise the right arm to its
full extent, and point northward, turning its
head, at the same time, so as to look him full in
the face. These movements were three times
repeated, and, after that, the figure came to rest
in its normal and familiar position.</p>

<p>The reader will not suppose, any more than
Mr. Batchel supposed, that a figure painted upon
glass had suddenly been endowed with the
power of movement. But that there had been
the appearance of movement admitted of no
doubt, and Mr. Batchel was not so incurious as
to let the matter pass without some attempt at
investigation. It must be remembered, too,
that an experience in the old library, which has
been previously recorded, had pre-disposed him
to give attention to signs which another man
might have wished to explain away. He was
not willing, therefore, to leave this matter
where it stood. He was quite prepared to think
that his eye had been deceived, but was none
the less determined to find out what had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
deceived it. One thing he had no difficulty in
deciding. If the movement had not been
actually within the Baptist&rsquo;s figure, it had been
immediately behind it. Without delay, therefore,
he passed out of the church and locked the
door after him, with the intention of examining
the other side of the window.</p>

<p>Every inhabitant of Stoneground knows,
and laments, the ruin of the old Manor House.
Its loss by fire some fifteen years ago was
a calamity from which the parish has never
recovered. The estate was acquired, soon after
the destruction of the house, by speculators who
have been unable to turn it to any account, and
it has for a decade or longer been &ldquo;let alone,&rdquo;
except by the forces of Nature and the wantonness
of trespassers. The charred remains of the
house still project above the surrounding heaps
of fallen masonry, which have long been overgrown
by such vegetation as thrives on neglected
ground; and what was once a stately
house, with its garden and park in fine order,
has given place to a scene of desolation and
ruin.</p>

<p>Stoneground Church was built, some 600
years ago, within the enclosure of the Manor
House, or, as it was anciently termed, the
Burystead, and an excellent stratum of gravel
such as no builder would wisely disregard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
brought the house and Church unusually near
together. In more primitive days, the nearness
probably caused no inconvenience; but when
change and progress affected the popular idea of
respectful distance, the Churchyard came to
be separated by a substantial stone wall, of
sufficient height to secure the privacy of the
house.</p>

<p>The change was made with necessary regard
to economy of space. The Eastern wall of the
Church already projected far into the garden of
the Manor, and lay but fifty yards from the
south front of the house. On that side of the
Churchyard, therefore, the new wall was set
back. Running from the north to the nearest
corner of the Church, it was there built up to
the Church itself, and then continued from the
southern corner, leaving the Eastern wall and
window within the garden of the Squire. It
was his ivy that clung to the wall of the
Church, and his trees that shaded the window
from the morning sun.</p>

<p>Whilst we have been recalling these facts,
Mr. Batchel has made his way out of the Church
and through the Churchyard, and has arrived at
a small door in the boundary wall, close to the
S.E. corner of the chancel. It was a door which
some Squire of the previous century had made,
to give convenient access to the Church for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
himself and his household. It has no present
use, and Mr. Batchel had some difficulty in
getting it open. It was not long, however,
before he stood on the inner side, and was
examining the second light of the window.
There was a tolerably bright moon, and the
dark surface of the glass could be distinctly
seen, as well as the wirework placed there for
its protection.</p>

<p>A tall birch, one of the trees of the old
Churchyard, had thrust its lower boughs across
the window, and their silvery bark shone in the
moonlight. The boughs were bare of leaves,
and only very slightly interrupted Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s
view of the Baptist&rsquo;s figure, the leaden outline
of which was clearly traceable. There was
nothing, however, to account for the movement
which Mr. Batchel was curious to investigate.</p>

<p>He was about to turn homewards in some
disappointment, when a cloud obscured the
moon again, and reduced the light to what it
had been before he left the Church. Mr.
Batchel watched the darkening of the window
and the objects near it, and as the figure of the
Baptist disappeared from view there came into
sight a creamy vaporous figure of another
person lightly poised upon the bough of the
tree, and almost coincident in position with the
picture of the Saint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>It could hardly be described as the figure of
a person. It had more the appearance of half a
person, and fancifully suggested to Mr. Batchel,
who was fond of whist, one of the diagonally
bisected knaves in a pack of cards, as he appears
when another card conceals a triangular half of
the bust.</p>

<p>There was no question, now, of going home.
Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s eyes were riveted upon the
apparition. It disappeared again for a moment,
when an interval between two clouds restored
the light of the moon; but no sooner had the
second cloud replaced the first than the figure
again became distinct. And upon this, its
single arm was raised three times, pointing
northwards towards the ruined house, just as
the figure of the Baptist had seemed to point
when Mr. Batchel had seen it from within the
Church.</p>

<p>It was natural that upon receipt of this sign
Mr. Batchel should step nearer to the tree, from
which he was still at some little distance, and
as he moved, the figure floated obliquely downwards
and came to rest in a direct line between
him and the ruins of the house. It rested, not
upon the ground, but in just such a position as
it would have occupied if the lower parts had
been there, and in this position it seemed to
await Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s advance. He made such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
haste to approach it as was possible upon
ground encumbered with ivy and brambles, and
the figure responded to every advance of
his by moving further in the direction of the
ruin.</p>

<p>As the ground improved, the progress
became more rapid. Soon they were both upon
an open stretch of grass, which in better days
had been a lawn, and still the figure retreated
towards the building, with Mr. Batchel in
respectful pursuit. He saw it, at last, poised
upon the summit of a heap of masonry, and it
disappeared, at his near approach, into a crevice
between two large stones.</p>

<p>The timely re-appearance of the moon just
enabled Mr. Batchel to perceive this crevice, and
he took advantage of the interval of light to
mark the place. Taking up a large twig that lay
at his feet, he inserted it between the stones. He
made a slit in the free end and drew into it one
of some papers that he had carried out of the
Church. After such a precaution it could
hardly be possible to lose the place&mdash;for, of
course, Mr. Batchel intended to return in daylight
and continue his investigation. For the
present, it seemed to be at an end. The light
was soon obscured again, but there was no
re-appearance of the singular figure he had
followed, so after remaining about the spot for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
a few minutes, Mr. Batchel went home to his
customary occupation.</p>

<p>He was not a man to let these occupations
be disturbed even by a somewhat exciting
adventure, nor was he one of those who regard
an unusual experience only as a sign of nervous
disorder. Mr. Batchel had far too broad a mind
to discredit his sensations because they were
not like those of other people. Even had his
adventure of the evening been shared by some
companion who saw less than he did, Mr.
Batchel would only have inferred that his own
part in the matter was being regarded as more
important.</p>

<p>Next morning, therefore, he lost no time in
returning to the scene of his adventure. He
found his mark undisturbed, and was able to
examine the crevice into which the apparition
had seemed to enter. It was a crevice formed
by the curved surfaces of two large stones
which lay together on the top of a small heap
of fallen rubbish, and these two stones Mr.
Batchel proceeded to remove. His strength was
just sufficient for the purpose. He laid the
stones upon the ground on either side of the
little mound, and then proceeded to remove,
with his hands, the rubbish upon which they
had rested, and amongst the rubbish he found,
tarnished and blackened, two silver coins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not a discovery which seemed to
afford any explanation of what had occurred
the night before, but Mr. Batchel could not
but suppose that there had been an attempt
to direct his attention to the coins, and he
carried them away with a view of submitting
them to a careful examination. Taking them
up to his bedroom he poured a little water
into a hand basin, and soon succeeded, with
the aid of soap and a nail brush, in making
them tolerably clean. Ten minutes later, after
adding ammonia to the water, he had made
them bright, and after carefully drying them,
was able to make his examination. They were
two crowns of the time of Queen Anne, minted,
as a small letter E indicated, at Edinburgh,
and stamped with the roses and plumes which
testified to the English and Welsh silver in
their composition. The coins bore no date,
but Mr. Batchel had no hesitation in assigning
them to the year 1708 or thereabouts. They
were handsome coins, and in themselves a find
of considerable interest, but there was nothing
to show why he had been directed to their place
of concealment. It was an enigma, and he
could not solve it. He had other work to do,
so he laid the two crowns upon his dressing
table, and proceeded to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel thought little more of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
coins until bedtime, when he took them from
the table and bestowed upon them another
admiring examination by the light of his
candle. But the examination told him nothing
new: he laid them down again, and, before
very long, had lain his own head upon the
pillow.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s custom to read himself
to sleep. At this time he happened to be re-reading
the Waverley novels, and &ldquo;Woodstock&rdquo;
lay upon the reading-stand which was always
placed at his bedside. As he read of the cleverly
devised apparition at Woodstock, he naturally
asked himself whether he might not have been
the victim of some similar trickery, but was
not long in coming to the conclusion that his
experience admitted of no such explanation.
He soon dismissed the matter from his mind
and went on with his book.</p>

<p>On this occasion, however, he was tired of
reading before he was ready for sleep; it was
long in coming, and then did not come to stay.
His rest, in fact, was greatly disturbed. Again
and again, perhaps every hour or so, he was
awakened by an uneasy consciousness of some
other presence in the room.</p>

<p>Upon one of his later awakenings, he was
distinctly sensible of a sound, or what he
described to himself as the &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; of a sound.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
He compared it to the whining of a dog that
had lost its voice. It was not a very intelligible
comparison, but still it seemed to describe his
sensation. The sound, if we may so call it
caused him first to sit up in bed and look
well about him, and then, when nothing had
come of that, to light his candle. It was not
to be expected that anything should come of
that, but it had seemed a comfortable thing
to do, and Mr. Batchel left the candle alight
and read his book for half an hour or so, before
blowing it out.</p>

<p>After this, there was no further interruption,
but Mr. Batchel distinctly felt, when it was
time to leave his bed, that he had had a bad
night. The coins, almost to his surprise, lay
undisturbed. He went to ascertain this as soon
as he was on his feet. He would almost have
welcomed their removal, or at any rate, some
change which might have helped him towards
a theory of his adventure. There was, however,
nothing. If he had, in fact, been visited during
the night, the coins would seem to have had
nothing to do with the matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel left the two crowns lying on
his table on this next day, and went about his
ordinary duties. They were such duties as
afforded full occupation for his mind, and he
gave no more than a passing thought to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
coins, until he was again retiring to rest. He
had certainly intended to return to the heap
of rubbish from which he had taken them, but
had not found leisure to do so. He did not
handle the coins again. As he undressed, he
made some attempt to estimate their value,
but without having arrived at any conclusion,
went on to think of other things, and in a
little while had lain down to rest again, hoping
for a better night.</p>

<p>His hopes were disappointed. Within an
hour of falling asleep he found himself awakened
again by the voiceless whining he so well
remembered. This sound, as for convenience
we will call it, was now persistent and continuous.
Mr. Batchel gave up even trying to
sleep, and as he grew more restless and uneasy,
decided to get up and dress.</p>

<p>It was the entire cessation of the sound at
this juncture which led him to a suspicion.
His rising was evidently giving satisfaction.
From that it was easy to infer that something
had been desired of him, both on the present
and the preceding night. Mr. Batchel was not
one to hold himself aloof in such a case. If help
was wanted, even in such unnatural circumstances,
he was ready to offer it. He determined,
accordingly, to return to the Manor
House, and when he had finished dressing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
descended the stairs, put on a warm overcoat and
went out, closing his hall door behind him,
without having heard any more of the sound,
either whilst dressing, or whilst leaving the
house.</p>

<p>Once out of doors, the suspicion he had
formed was strengthened into a conviction.
There was no manner of doubt that he had been
fetched from his bed; for about 30 yards in front
of him he saw the strange creamy half-figure
making straight for the ruins. He followed it
as well as he could; as before, he was impeded
by the ivy and weeds, and the figure awaited
him; as before, it made straight for the heap of
masonry and disappeared as soon as Mr. Batchel
was at liberty to follow.</p>

<p>There were no dungeons, or subterranean
premises beneath the Manor House. It had
never been more than a house of residence, and
the building had been purely domestic in
character. Mr. Batchel was convinced that his
adventure would prove unromantic, and felt
some impatience at losing again, what he had
begun to call his triangular friend. If this
friend wanted anything, it was not easy to say
why he had so tamely disappeared. There
seemed nothing to be done but to wait until
he came out again.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel had a pipe in his pocket, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
seated himself upon the base of a sun-dial
within full view of the spot. He filled and
smoked his pipe, sitting in momentary expectation
of some further sign, but nothing appeared.
He heard the hedgehogs moving about him in
the undergrowth, and now and then the sound
of a restless bird overhead, otherwise all was
still. He smoked a second pipe without any
further discovery, and that finished, he knocked
out the ashes against his boot, walked to the
mound, near to which his labelled stick was
lying, thrust the stick into the place where the
figure had disappeared, and went back to bed,
where he was rewarded with five hours of sound
sleep.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel had made up his mind that the
next day ought to be a day of disclosure. He
was early at the Manor House, this time provided
with the gardener&rsquo;s pick, and a spade. He
thrust the pick into the place from which he
had removed his mark, and loosened the rubbish
thoroughly. With his hands, and with his
spade, he was not long in reducing the size of
the heap by about one-half, and there he found
more coins.</p>

<p>There were three more crowns, two half-crowns,
and a dozen or so of smaller coins. All
these Mr. Batchel wrapped carefully in his
handkerchief, and after a few minutes rest went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
on with his task. As it proved, the task was nearly
over. Some strips of oak about nine inches
long, were next uncovered, and then, what Mr.
Batchel had begun to expect, the lid of a box,
with the hinges still attached. It lay, face
downwards, upon a flat stone. It proved, when
he had taken it up, to be almost unsoiled, and
above a long and wide slit in the lid was the
gilded legend, &ldquo;for ye poore&rdquo; in the graceful
lettering and the redundant spelling of two
centuries ago.</p>

<p>The meaning of all this Mr. Batchel was
not long in interpreting. That the box and its
contents had fallen and been broken amongst
the masonry, was evident enough. It was as
evident that it had been concealed in one of
the walls brought down by the fire, and Mr.
Batchel had no doubt at all that he had been in
the company of a thief, who had once stolen
the poor-box from the Church. His task seemed
to be at an end, a further rummage revealed
nothing new. Mr. Batchel carefully collected
the fragments of the box, and left the place.</p>

<p>His next act cannot be defended. He must
have been aware that these coins were &ldquo;treasure
trove,&rdquo; and therefore the property of the Crown.
In spite of this, he determined to convert them
into current coin, as he well knew how, and to
apply the proceeds to the Inundation Fund about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
which he was so anxious. Treating them as his
own property, he cleaned them all, as he had
cleaned the two crowns, sent them to an antiquarian
friend in London to sell for him, and
awaited the result. The lid of the poor box he
still preserves as a relic of the adventure.</p>

<p>His antiquarian friend did not keep him
long waiting. The coins had been eagerly
bought, and the price surpassed any expectation
that Mr. Batchel had allowed himself to entertain.
He had sent the package to London on
Saturday morning. Upon the following Tuesday,
the last post in the evening brought a
cheque for twenty guineas. The brief subscription
list of the Inundation Fund lay upon his
desk, and he at once entered the amount he had
so strangely come by, but could not immediately
decide upon its description. Leaving the line
blank, therefore, he merely wrote down £21 in
the cash column, to be assigned to its source in
some suitable form of words when he should
have found time to frame them.</p>

<p>In this state he left the subscription list
upon his desk, when he retired for the night. It
occurred to him as he was undressing, that the
twenty guineas might suitably be described as
a &ldquo;restitution,&rdquo; and so he determined to enter
it upon the line he had left vacant. As he
reconsidered the matter in the morning, he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
no reason to alter his decision, and he went
straight from his bedroom to his desk to make
the entry and have done with it.</p>

<p>There was an incident in the adventure,
however, upon which Mr. Batchel had not
reckoned. As he approached the list, he saw, to
his amazement, that the line had been filled in.
In a crabbed, elongated hand was written, &ldquo;At
last, <abbr title="Saint Matthew 5:26">St. Matt. v. 26</abbr>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What may seem more strange is that the
handwriting was familiar to Mr. Batchel, he
could not at first say why. His memory, however,
in such matters, was singularly good, and
before breakfast was over he felt sure of having
identified the writer.</p>

<p>His confidence was not misplaced. He went
to the parish chest, whose contents he had
thoroughly examined in past intervals of leisure,
and took out the roll of parish constable&rsquo;s
accounts. In a few minutes he discovered the
handwriting of which he was in search. It was
unmistakably that of Salathiel Thrapston,
constable from 1705-1710, who met his death in
the latter year, whilst in the execution of his
duty. The reader will scarcely need to be
reminded of the text of the Gospel at the place
of reference&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt by no means come out thence
till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="stl">LUBRIETTA.</span></h2>


<p>For the better understanding of this
narrative we shall furnish the reader with a few
words of introduction. It amounts to no more
than a brief statement of facts which Mr.
Batchel obtained from the Lady Principal of
the European College in Puna, but the facts
nevertheless are important. The narrative
itself was obtained from Mr. Batchel with
difficulty: he was disposed to regard it as unsuitable
for publication because of the delicate
nature of the situations with which it deals.
When, however, it was made clear to him that
it would be recorded in such a manner as
would interest only a very select body of readers,
his scruples were overcome, and he was induced
to communicate the experience now to be related.
Those who read it will not fail to see
that they are in a manner pledged to deal very
discreetly with the knowledge they are privileged
to share.</p>

<p>Lubrietta Rodria is described by her Lady
Principal as an attractive and high-spirited
girl of seventeen, belonging to the Purple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Indian commerce. Her nationality was not
precisely known; but drawing near, as she did,
to a marriageable age, and being courted by
more than one eligible suitor, she was naturally
an object of great interest to her schoolfellows,
with whom her personal beauty and amiable
temper had always made her a favourite. She
was not, the Lady Principal thought, a girl
who would be regarded in Christian countries
as of very high principle; but none the less,
she was one whom it was impossible not to
like.</p>

<p>Her career at the college had ended sensationally.
She had been immoderately anxious
about her final examination, and its termination
had found her in a state of collapse. They
had at once removed her to her father&rsquo;s house
in the country, where she received such nursing
and assiduous attention as her case required.
It was apparently of no avail. For three weeks
she lay motionless, deprived of speech, and
voluntarily, taking no food. Then for a further
period of ten days she lay in a plight still more
distressing. She lost all consciousness, and,
despite the assurance of the doctors, her parents
could hardly be persuaded that she lived.</p>

<p>Her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancé</i> who by this time had been
declared, was in despair, not only from natural
affection for Lubrietta, but from remorse. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
was his intellectual ambition that had incited
her to the eagerness in study which was
threatening such dire results, and it was well
understood that neither of the lovers would
survive these anxious days of watching if they
were not to be survived by both.</p>

<p>After ten days, however, a change supervened.
Lubrietta came back to life amid the
frenzied rejoicing of the household and all her
circle. She recovered her health and strength
with incredible speed, and within three months
was married&mdash;as the Lady Principal had cause
to believe, with the happiest prospects.</p>

<p class="tb">*<span class="ast">*</span><span class="ast">*</span><span class="ast">*</span><span class="ast">*</span><span class="ast">*</span><span class="ast">*</span></p>

<p>Mr. Batchel had not, whilst residing at
Stoneground, lost touch with the University
which had given him his degree, and in which
he had formerly held one or two minor offices.
He had earned no great distinction as a scholar,
but had taken a degree in honours, and was
possessed of a useful amount of general knowledge,
and in this he found not only constant
pleasure, but also occasional profit.</p>

<p>The University had made herself, for better
or worse, an examiner of a hundred times as
many students as she could teach; her system
of examinations had extended to the very
limits of the British Empire, and her certificates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of proficiency were coveted in every
quarter of the globe.</p>

<p>In the examination of these students, Mr.
Batchel, who had considerable experience in
teaching, was annually employed. Papers from
all parts of the world were to be found littered
about his study, and the examination of these
papers called for some weeks of strenuous
labour at every year&rsquo;s end. As the weeks passed,
he would anxiously watch the growth of a neat
stack of papers in the corner of the room, which
indicated the number to which marks had been
assigned and reported to Cambridge. The day
upon which the last of these was laid in its
place was a day of satisfaction, second only to
that which later on brought him a substantial
cheque to remunerate him for his labours.</p>

<p>During this period of special effort, Mr.
Batchel&rsquo;s servants had their share of its
discomforts. The chairs and tables they wanted
to dust and to arrange, were loaded with papers
which they were forbidden to touch; and
although they were warned against showing
visitors into any room where these papers were
lying, Mr. Batchel would inconsiderately lay
them in every room he had. The privacy of his
study, however, where the work was chiefly
done, was strictly guarded, and no one was
admitted there unless by Mr. Batchel himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Imagine his annoyance, therefore, when he
returned from an evening engagement at the
beginning of the month of January, and found a
stranger seated in the study! Yet the annoyance
was not long in subsiding. The visitor
was a lady, and as she sat by the lamp, a glance
was enough to shew that she was young, and
very beautiful. The interest which this young
lady excited in Mr. Batchel was altogether
unusual, as unusual as was the visit of such a
person at such a time. His conjecture was
that she had called to give him notice of a
marriage, but he was really charmed by her
presence, and was quite content to find her
in no haste to state her errand. The manner,
however, of the lady was singular, for neither
by word nor movement did she show that she
was conscious of Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s entry into the
room.</p>

<p>He began at length with his customary
formula &ldquo;What can I have the pleasure of doing
for you?&rdquo; and when, at the sound of his voice,
she turned her fine dark eyes upon him, he
saw that they were wet with tears.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel was now really moved. As a tear
fell upon the lady&rsquo;s cheek, she raised her hand as
if to conceal it&mdash;a brilliant sapphire sparkling
in the lamp-light as she did so. And then the
lady&rsquo;s distress, and the exquisite grace of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
her presence, altogether overcame him. There
stole upon him a strange feeling of tenderness
which he supposed to be paternal,
but knew nevertheless to be indiscreet. He
was a prudent man, with strict notions of
propriety, so that, ostensibly with a view to
giving the lady a few minutes in which to
recover her composure, he quietly left the study
and went into another room, to pull himself
together.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel, like most solitary men, had
a habit of talking to himself. &ldquo;It is of no
use, R.&nbsp;B.,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to pretend that you have
retired on this damsel&rsquo;s account. If you don&rsquo;t
take care, you&rsquo;ll make a fool of yourself.&rdquo; He
took up from the table a volume of the encyclopedia
in which, the day before, he had been
looking up Pestalozzi, and turned over the
pages in search of something to restore his
equanimity. An article on Perspective proved
to be the very thing. Wholly unromantic in
character, its copious presentment of hard fact
relieved his mind, and he was soon threading
his way along paths of knowledge to which he
was little accustomed. He applied his remedy
with such persistence that when four or five
minutes had passed, he felt sufficiently composed
to return to the study. He framed, as he went,
a suitable form of words with which to open the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
conversation, and took with him his register of
Banns of Marriage, of which he thought he foresaw
the need. As he opened the study-door,
the book fell from his hands to the ground, so
completely was he overcome by surprise, for he
found the room empty. The lady had disappeared;
her chair stood vacant before him.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel sat down for a moment, and
then rang the bell. It was answered by the
boy who always attended upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did the lady go?&rdquo; asked Mr. Batchel.</p>

<p>The boy looked bewildered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lady you showed into the study before
I came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, sir, I never shown anyone into the
study; I never do when you&rsquo;re out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a lady here,&rdquo; said Mr. Batchel,
&ldquo;when I returned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy now looked incredulous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you not let someone out just now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;I put the chain
on the front door as soon as you came in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was conclusive. The chain upon the hall-door
was an ancient and cumbrous thing, and
could not be manipulated without considerable
effort, and a great deal of noise. Mr. Batchel
released the boy, and began to think furiously.
He was not, as the reader is well aware, without
some experience of the supranormal side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
nature, and he knew of course that the visit of
this enthralling lady had a purpose. He was
beginning to know, however, that it had had an
effect. He sat before his fire reproducing her
image, and soon gave it up in disgust because
his imagination refused to do her justice. He
could recover the details of her appearance, but
could combine them into nothing that would
reproduce the impression she had first made
upon him.</p>

<p>He was unable now to concentrate his
attention upon the examination papers lying on
his table. His mind wandered so often to the
other topic that he felt himself to be in danger
of marking the answers unfairly. He turned
away from his work, therefore, and moved to
another chair, where he sat down to read. It
was the chair in which she herself had sat, and
he made no attempt to pretend that he had
chosen it on any other account. He had, in
fact, made some discoveries about himself during
the last half-hour, and he gave himself another
surprise when he came to select his book. In
the ordinary course of what he had supposed to
be his nature, he would certainly have returned
to the article on Perspective; it was lying open
in the next room, and he had read no more than
a tenth part of it. But instead of that, his
thoughts went back to a volume he had but once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
opened, and that for no more than two minutes.
He had received the book, by way of birthday
present, early in the preceding year, from a
relative who had bestowed either no consideration
at all, or else a great deal of cunning, upon
its selection. It was a collection of 17th century
lyrics, which Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s single glance had
sufficed to condemn. Regarding the one lyric
he had read as a sort of literary freak, he had
banished the book to one of the spare bedrooms,
and had never seen it since. And now, after this
long interval, the absurd lines which his eye
had but once lighted upon, were recurring to his
mind:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Fair, sweet, and young, receive a prize<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reserved for your victorious eyes&rdquo;;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">and so far from thinking them absurd, as he
now recalled them, he went upstairs to fetch the
book, in which he was soon absorbed. The
lyrics no longer seemed unreasonable. He felt
conscious, as he read one after another, of a side
of nature that he had strangely neglected, and was
obliged to admit that the men whose feelings
were set forth in the various sonnets and
poems had a fine gift of expression.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Thus, whilst I look for her in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Methinks I am a child again,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And of my shadow am a-chasing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all her graces are to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like apparitions that I see,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But never can come near th&rsquo; embracing.&rdquo;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">No! these men were not, as he had formerly
supposed, writing with air, and he felt ashamed at
having used the term &ldquo;freak&rdquo; at their expense.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel read more of the lyrics, some of
them twice, and one of them much oftener.
That one he began to commit to memory, and
since the household had retired to rest, to recite
aloud. He had been unaware that literature
contained anything so beautiful, and as he
looked again at the book to recover an expression
his memory had lost, a tear fell upon the
page. It was a thing so extraordinary that Mr.
Batchel first looked at the ceiling, but when
he found that it was indeed a tear from his own
eye he was immoderately pleased with himself.
Had not she also shed a tear as she sat upon the
same chair? The fact seemed to draw them
together.</p>

<p>Contemplation of this sort was, however, a
luxury to be enjoyed in something like moderation.
Mr. Batchel soon laid down his lyric
and savagely began to add up columns of marks,
by way of discipline; and when he had totalled
several pages of these, respect for his normal
self had returned with sufficient force to take
him off to bed.</p>

<p>The matter of his dreams, or whether he
dreamed at all, has not been disclosed. He
awoke, at any rate, in a calmer state of mind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and such romantic thoughts as remained were
effectually dispelled by the sight of his own
countenance when he began to shave. &ldquo;Fancy
you spouting lyrics,&rdquo; he said, as he dabbed the
brush upon his mouth, and by the time he was
ready for breakfast he pronounced himself
cured.</p>

<p>The prosaic labours awaiting him in the
study were soon forced upon his notice, and
for once he did not regret it. Amongst the
letters lying upon the breakfast table was one
from the secretary who controlled the system
of examination. The form of the envelope was
too familiar to leave him in doubt as to
what it contained. It was a letter which, to
a careful man like Mr. Batchel, seemed to have
the nature of a reproof, inasmuch as it
probably asked for information which it had
already been his duty to furnish. The contents
of the envelope, when he had impatiently torn
it open, answered to his expectation&mdash;he was
formally requested to supply the name and the
marks of candidate No. 1004, and he wondered,
as he ate his breakfast, how he had omitted
to return them. He hunted out the paper of
No. 1004 as soon as the meal was over. The
candidate proved to be one Lubrietta Bodria, of
whom, of course, he had never heard, and her
answers had all been marked. He could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
understand why they should have been made
the subject of enquiry.</p>

<p>He took her papers in his hand, and looked
at them again as he stood with his back to
the fire, having lit the pipe which invariably
followed his breakfast, and then he discovered
something much harder to understand. The
marks were not his own. In place of the usual
sketchy numerals, hardly decipherable to any
but himself, he saw figures which were carefully
formed; and the marks assigned to the
first answer, as he saw it on the uppermost
sheet, were higher than the maximum number
obtainable for that question.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel laid down his pipe and seated
himself at the table. He was greatly puzzled.
As he turned over the sheets of No. 1004 he
found all the other questions marked in like
manner, and making a total of half as much
again as the highest possible number. &ldquo;Who the
dickens,&rdquo; he said, using a meaningless, but not
uncommon expression, &ldquo;has been playing with
this; and how came I to pass it over?&rdquo; The
need of the moment, however, was to furnish
the proper marks to the secretary at Cambridge,
and Mr. Batchel proceeded to read No. 1004
right through.</p>

<p>He soon found that he had read it all
before, and the matter began to bristle with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
queries. It proved, in fact, to be a paper over
which he had spent some time, and for a
singularly interesting reason. He had learned
from a friend in the Indian Civil Service
that an exaggerated value was often placed
by ambitious Indians and Cingalese upon a
European education, and that many aspiring
young men declined to take a wife who had
not passed this very examination. It was to
Mr. Batchel a disquieting reflection that his
blue pencil was not only marking mistakes,
but might at the same time be cancelling
matrimonial engagements, and his friend&rsquo;s communication
had made him scrupulously careful
in examining the work of young ladies in
Oriental Schools. The matter had occurred to
him at once as he had examined the answers of
Lubrietta Rodria. He perfectly remembered
the question upon which her success depended.
A problem in logic had been answered by a
rambling and worthless argument, to which,
somehow, the right conclusion was appended:
the conclusion might be a happy guess, or it
might have been secured by less honest means,
but Mr. Batchel, following his usual practice,
gave no marks for it. It was not here that he
found any cause for hesitation, but when he
came to the end of the paper and found that
the candidate had only just failed, he had turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
back to the critical question, imagined an
eligible bachelor awaiting the result of the
examination, and then, after a period of vacillation,
had hastily put the symbol of failure upon
the paper lest he should be tempted to bring his
own charity to the rescue of the candidate&rsquo;s
logic, and unfairly add the three marks which
would suffice to pass her.</p>

<p>As he now read the answer for the second
time, the same pitiful thought troubled him,
and this time more than before; for over the
edge of the paper of No. 1004 there persistently
arose the image of the young lady with the
sapphire ring. It directed the current of his
thoughts. Suppose that Lubrietta Rodria were
anything like that! and what if the arguments
of No. 1004 were worthless! Young ladies were
notoriously weak in argument, and as strong in
conclusions! and after all, the conclusion was
correct, and ought not a correct conclusion to
have its marks? There followed much more to
the same purpose, and in the end Mr. Batchel
stultified himself by adding the necessary three
marks, and passing the candidate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This comes precious near to being a job,&rdquo;
he remarked, as he entered the marks upon the
form and sealed it in the envelope, &ldquo;but No.
1004 must pass, this time.&rdquo; He enclosed in the
envelope a request to know why the marks had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
been asked for, since they had certainly been
returned in their proper place. A brief official
reply informed him next day that the marks he
had returned exceeded the maximum, and must,
therefore, have been wrongly entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Mr. Batchel, &ldquo;is a curious
coincidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Curious as it certainly was, it was less
curious than what immediately followed. It was
Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s practice to avoid any delay in
returning these official papers, and he went out,
there and then, to post his envelope. The Post
Office was no more than a hundred yards from
his door, and in three minutes he was in his
study again. The first object that met his eye
there was a beautiful sapphire ring lying upon
the papers of No. 1004, which had remained upon
the table.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel at once recognised the ring.
&ldquo;I knew it was precious near a job,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t know that it was as near as this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took up the ring and examined it. It
looked like a ring of great value; the stone was
large and brilliant, and the setting was of fine
workmanship. &ldquo;Now what on earth,&rdquo; said Mr.
Batchel, &ldquo;am I to do with this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The nearest jeweller to Stoneground was a
competent and experienced tradesman of the
old school. He was a member of the local<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Natural History Society, and in that capacity
Mr. Batchel had made intimate acquaintance
with him. To this jeweller, therefore, he
carried the ring, and asked him what he thought
of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you forty pounds for it,&rdquo; said the
jeweller.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel replied that the ring was not
his. &ldquo;What about the make of it?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Is it English?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The jeweller replied that it was unmistakably
Indian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are sure?&rdquo; said Mr. Batchel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certain,&rdquo; said the jeweller. &ldquo;Major
Ackroyd brought home one like it, all but
the stone, from Puna; I repaired it for him
last year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The information was enough, if not more
than enough, for Mr. Batchel. He begged a
suitable case from his friend the jeweller, and
within an hour had posted the ring to Miss
Lubrietta Rodria at the European College in
Puna. At the same time he wrote to the
Principal the letter whose answer is embodied
in the preface to this narrative.</p>

<p>Having done this, Mr. Batchel felt more at
ease. He had given Lubrietta Rodria what he
amiably called the benefit of the doubt, but it
should never be said that he had been bribed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>The rest of his papers he marked with
fierce justice. A great deal of the work, in his
zeal, he did twice over, but his conscience amply
requited him for the superfluous labour. The
last paper was marked within a day of the
allotted time, Mr. Batchel shortly afterwards
received his cheque, and was glad to think that
the whole matter was at an end.</p>

<p class="tb">*<span class="ast">*</span><span class="ast">*</span><span class="ast">*</span><span class="ast">*</span><span class="ast">*</span><span class="ast">*</span></p>

<p>That Lubrietta had been absent from India
whilst her relatives and attendants were trying
to restore her to consciousness, he had good
reason to know. His friends, for the most part,
took a very narrow view of human nature and
its possibilities, so that he kept his experience,
for a long time, to himself; there were personal
reasons for not discussing the incident. The
reader has been already told upon what understanding
it is recorded here.</p>

<p>There remains, however, an episode which
Mr. Batchel all but managed to suppress. Upon
the one occasion when he allowed himself to
speak of this matter, he was being pressed for
a description of the sapphire ring, and was not
very successful in his attempt to describe it.
There was no reason, of course, why this should
lay his good faith under suspicion. Few of us
could pass an examination upon objects with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
which we are supposed to be familiar, or say
which of our tables have three legs, and which
four.</p>

<p>One of Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s auditors, however, took
a captious view of the matter, and brusquely
remarked, in imitation of a more famous sceptic,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s no sich a thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel, of course, recognised the
phrase, and it was his eagerness to establish his
credit that committed him at this point to a
last disclosure about Lubrietta. He drew a
sapphire ring from his pocket, handed it to the
incredulous auditor, and addressed him in the
manner of Mrs. Gamp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! you bage creetur, have I had this
ring three year or more to be told there ain&rsquo;t no
sech a thing. Go along with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I thought the ring was sent back,&rdquo;
said more than one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you come by it?&rdquo; said all the
others.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel thereupon admitted that he had
closed his story prematurely. About six weeks
after the return of the ring to Puna he had found
it once again upon his table, returned through
the post. Enclosed in the package was a note
which Mr. Batchel, being now committed to
this part of the story, also passed round for
inspection. It ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquo3">
<p>&ldquo;Accept the ring, dear one, and wear
it for my sake. Fail not to think sometimes
of her whom you have made happy.&mdash;L.&nbsp;R.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth am I to do with this?&rdquo;
Mr. Batchel had asked himself again. And this
time he had answered the question, after the
briefest possible delay, by slipping the ring
upon his fourth finger.</p>

<p>The book of Lyrics remained downstairs
amongst the books in constant use. Mr. Batchel
can repeat at least half of the collection from
memory.</p>

<p>He knows well enough that such terms
as &ldquo;dear one&rdquo; are addressed to bald gentlemen
only in a Pickwickian sense, but even with
that sense the letter gives him pleasure.</p>

<p>He admits that he thinks very often of
&ldquo;her whom he has made happy,&rdquo; but that he
cannot exclude from his thoughts at these
times an ungenerous regret. It is that he has
also made happy a nameless Oriental gentleman
whom he presumptuously calls &ldquo;the other
fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI.<br />

<span class="stl">THE ROCKERY.</span></h2>


<p>The Vicar&rsquo;s garden at Stoneground has
certainly been enclosed for more than seven
centuries, and during the whole of that time
its almost sacred privacy has been regarded as
permanent and unchangeable. It has remained
for the innovators of later and more audacious
days to hint that it might be given into other
hands, and still carry with it no curse that
should make a new possessor hasten to undo
his irreverence. Whether there can be warrant
for such confidence, time will show. The
experiences already related will show that the
privacy of the garden has been counted upon
both by good men and worse. And here is a
story, in its way, more strange than any.</p>

<p>By way of beginning, it may be well to
describe a part of the garden not hitherto
brought into notice. That part lies on the
western boundary, where the garden slopes
down to a sluggish stream, hardly a stream at
all, locally known as the Lode. The Lode bounds
the garden on the west along its whole length,
and there the moor-hen builds her nest, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the kingfisher is sometimes, but in these days
too rarely, seen. But the centre of vision, as
it were, of this western edge lies in a cluster
of tall elms. Towards these all the garden
paths converge, and about their base is raised a
bank of earth, upon which is heaped a rockery
of large stones lately overgrown with ferns.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s somewhat prim taste in
gardening had long resented this disorderly
bank. In more than one place in his garden
had wild confusion given place to a park-like
trimness, and there were not a few who would
say that the change was not for the better.
Mr. Batchel, however, went his own way, and
in due time determined to remove the rockery.
He was puzzled by its presence; he could see
no reason why a bank should have been raised
about the feet of the elms, and surmounted
with stones; not a ray of sunshine ever found
its way there, and none but coarse and uninteresting
plants had established themselves.
Whoever had raised the bank had done it
ignorantly, or with some purpose not easy for
Mr. Batchel to conjecture.</p>

<p>Upon a certain day, therefore, in the early
part of December, when the garden had been
made comfortable for its winter rest, he began,
with the assistance of his gardener, to remove
the stones into another place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>We do but speak according to custom in
this matter, and there are few readers who
will not suspect the truth, which is that the
gardener began to remove the stones, whilst
Mr. Batchel stood by and delivered criticisms
of very slight value. Such strength, in fact,
as Mr. Batchel possessed had concentrated itself
upon the mind, and somewhat neglected his
body, and what he called help, during his
presence in the garden, was called by another
name when the gardener and his boy were left
to themselves, with full freedom of speech.</p>

<p>There were few of the stones rolled down
by the gardener that Mr. Batchel could even
have moved, but his astonishment at their size
soon gave place to excitement at their appearance.
His antiquarian tastes were strong, and
were soon busily engaged. For, as the stones
rolled down, his eyes were feasted, in a rapid
succession, by capitals of columns, fragments of
moulded arches and mullions, and other relics
of ecclesiastical building.</p>

<p>Repeatedly did he call the gardener down
from his work to put these fragments together,
and before long there were several complete
lengths of arcading laid upon the path. Stones
which, perhaps, had been separated for
centuries, once more came together, and Mr.
Batchel, rubbing his hands in excited satisfaction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
declared that he might recover the best
parts of a Church by the time the rockery had
been demolished.</p>

<p>The interest of the gardener in such
matters was of a milder kind. &ldquo;We must go
careful,&rdquo; he merely observed, &ldquo;when we come
to the organ.&rdquo; They went on removing more
and more stones, until at length the whole bank
was laid bare, and Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s chief purpose
achieved. How the stones were carefully arranged,
and set up in other parts of the garden,
is well known, and need not concern us now.</p>

<p>One detail, however, must not be omitted.
A large and stout stake of yew, evidently of
considerable age, but nevertheless quite sound,
stood exposed after the clearing of the bank.
There was no obvious reason for its presence,
but it had been well driven in, so well that the
strength of the gardener, or, if it made any
difference, of the gardener and Mr. Batchel
together, failed even to shake it. It was not
unsightly, and might have remained where it
was, had not the gardener exclaimed, &ldquo;This is
the very thing we want for the pump.&rdquo; It was
so obviously &ldquo;the very thing&rdquo; that its removal
was then and there decided upon.</p>

<p>The pump referred to was a small iron
pump used to draw water from the Lode. It had
been affixed to many posts in turn, and defied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
them all to hold it. Not that the pump was
at fault. It was a trifling affair enough. But
the pumpers were usually garden-boys, whose
impatient energy had never failed, before many
days, to wriggle the pump away from its supports.
When the gardener had, upon one
occasion, spent half a day in attaching it firmly
to a post, they had at once shaken out the post
itself. Since, therefore, the matter was causing
daily inconvenience, and the gardener becoming
daily more concerned for his reputation as a
rough carpenter, it was natural for him to
exclaim, &ldquo;This is the very thing.&rdquo; It was a
better stake than he had ever used, and as had
just been made evident, a stake that the ground
would hold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Mr. Batchel, &ldquo;it is the very
thing; but can we get it up?&rdquo; The gardener
always accepted this kind of query as a challenge,
and replied only by taking up a pick and
setting to work, Mr. Batchel, as usual, looking
on, and making, every now and then, a fruitless
suggestion. After a few minutes, however, he
made somewhat more than a suggestion. He
darted forward and laid his hand upon the pick.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see some copper?&rdquo; he asked quickly.</p>

<p>Every man who digs knows what a hiding
place there is in the earth. The monotony
of spade work is always relieved by a hope of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
turning up something unexpected. Treasure
lies dimly behind all these hopes, so that the
gardener, having seen Mr. Batchel excited over
so much that was precious from his own point
of view, was quite ready to look for something
of value to an ordinary reasonable man. Copper
might lead to silver, and that, in turn, to gold.
At Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s eager question, therefore, he
peered into the hole he had made, and examined
everything there that might suggest the
rounded form of a coin.</p>

<p>He soon saw what had arrested Mr. Batchel.
There was a lustrous scratch on the side of the
stake, evidently made by the pick, and though
the metal was copper, plainly enough, the
gardener felt that he had been deceived, and
would have gone on with his work. Copper of
that sort gave him no sort of excitement, and
only a feeble interest.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel, however, was on his hands and
knees. There was a small irregular plate of
copper nailed to the stake; without any
difficulty he tore it away from the nails, and
soon scraped it clean with a shaving of wood;
then, rising to his feet, he examined his find.</p>

<p>There was an inscription upon it, so legible
as to need no deciphering. It had been roughly
and effectually made with a hammer and nail,
the letters being formed by series of holes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
punched deeply into the metal, and what he
read was:&mdash;</p>

<p class="stake">
MOVE NOT THIS<br />
STAKE, NOV. 1, 1702.<br />
</p>

<p>But to move the stake was what Mr.
Batchel had determined upon, and the metal
plate he held in his hand interested him chiefly
as showing how long the post had been there.
He had happened, as he supposed, upon an
ancient landmark. The discovery, recorded
elsewhere, of a well, near to the edge of his
present lawn, had shown him that his premises
had once been differently arranged. One of the
minor antiquarian tasks he had set himself was
to discover and record the old arrangement, and
he felt that the position of this stake would
help him. He felt no doubt of its being a point
upon the western limit of the garden; not
improbably marked in this way to show where
the garden began, and where ended the ancient
hauling-way, which had been secured to the
public for purposes of navigation.</p>

<p>The gardener, meanwhile, was proceeding
with his work. With no small difficulty he
removed the rubble and clay which accounted
for the firmness of the stake. It grew dark as
the work went on, and a distant clock struck
five before it was completed. Five was the hour
at which the gardener usually went home; his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
day began early. He was not, however, a man
to leave a small job unfinished, and he went on
loosening the earth with his pick, and trying
the effect, at intervals, upon the firmness of the
stake. It naturally began to give, and could be
moved from side to side through a space of
some few inches. He lifted out the loosened
stones, and loosened more. His pick struck
iron, which, after loosening, proved to be links
of a rusted chain. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve buried a lot of
rubbish in this hole,&rdquo; he remarked, as he went
on loosening the chain, which, in the growing
darkness, could hardly be seen. Mr. Batchel,
meanwhile, occupied himself in a simpler task
of working the stake to and fro, by way of
loosening its hold. Ultimately it began to
move with greater freedom. The gardener laid
down his tool and grasped the stake, which his
master was still holding; their combined efforts
succeeded at once; the stake was lifted out.</p>

<p>It turned out to be furnished with an
unusually long and sharp point, which explained
the firmness of its hold upon the ground. The
gardener carried it to the neighbourhood of the
pump, in readiness for its next purpose, and
made ready to go home. He would drive the
stake to-morrow, he said, in the new place, and
make the pump so secure that not even the
boys could shake it. He also spoke of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
designs he had upon the chain, should it prove
to be of any considerable length. He was an
ingenious man, and his skill in converting
discarded articles to new uses was embarrassing
to his master. Mr. Batchel, as has been
said, was a prim gardener, and he had no liking
for makeshift devices. He had that day seen
his runner beans trained upon a length of old
gas-piping, and had no intention of leaving the
gardener in possession of such a treasure as a
rusty chain. What he said, however, and said
with truth, was that he wanted the chain for
himself. He had no practical use for it, and
hardly expected it to yield him any interest.
But a chain buried in 1702 must be examined&mdash;nothing
ancient comes amiss to a man of
antiquarian tastes.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel had noticed, whilst the gardener
had been carrying away the stake, that the chain
lay very loosely in the earth. The pick had
worked well round it. He said, therefore, that
the chain must be lifted out and brought to
him upon the morrow, bade his gardener good
night, and went in to his fireside.</p>

<p>This will appear to the reader to be a record
of the merest trifles, but all readers will accept
the reminder that there is no such thing as a
trifle, and that what appears to be trivial has
that appearance only so long as it stands alone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Regarded in the light of their consequences,
those matters which have seemed to be least
in importance, turn out, often enough, to be
the greatest. And these trifling occupations,
as we may call them for the last time, of Mr.
Batchel and the gardener, had consequences
which shall now be set down as Mr.
Batchel himself narrated them. But we must
take events in their order. At present Mr.
Batchel is at his fireside, and his gardener at
home with his family. The stake is removed,
and the hole, in which lies some sort of an
iron chain, is exposed.</p>

<p>Upon this particular evening Mr. Batchel
was dining out. He was a good natured man,
with certain mild powers of entertainment,
and his presence as an occasional guest was
not unacceptable at some of the more considerable
houses of the neighbourhood. And let us
hasten to observe that he was not a guest who
made any great impression upon the larders
or the cellars of his hosts. He liked port, but
he liked it only of good quality, and in small
quantity. When he returned from a dinner
party, therefore, he was never either in a
surfeited condition of body, or in any confusion
of mind. Not uncommonly after his return
upon such occasions did he perform accurate
work. Unfinished contributions to sundry local<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
journals were seldom absent from his desk.
They were his means of recreation. There they
awaited convenient intervals of leisure, and
Mr. Batchel was accustomed to say that of
these intervals he found none so productive
as a late hour, or hour and a half, after a
dinner party.</p>

<p>Upon the evening in question he returned,
about an hour before midnight, from dining
at the house of a retired officer residing in the
neighbourhood, and the evening had been somewhat
less enjoyable than usual. He had taken
in to dinner a young lady who had too persistently
assailed him with antiquarian questions.
Now Mr. Batchel did not like talking what he
regarded as &ldquo;shop,&rdquo; and was not much at home
with young ladies, to whom he knew that, in
the nature of things, he could be but imperfectly
acceptable. With infinite good will towards
them, and a genuine liking for their presence,
he felt that he had but little to offer them in
exchange. There was so little in common
between his life and theirs. He felt distinctly
at his worst when he found himself treated
as a mere scrap-book of information. It made
him seem, as he would express it, de-humanised.</p>

<p>Upon this particular evening the young
lady allotted to him, perhaps at her own request,
had made a scrap-book of him, and he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
returned home somewhat discontented, if also
somewhat amused. His discontent arose from
having been deprived of the general conversation
he so greatly, but so rarely, enjoyed.
His amusement was caused by the incongruity
between a very light-hearted young lady and
the subject upon which she had made him talk,
for she had talked of nothing else but modes
of burial.</p>

<p>He began to recall the conversation as he
lit his pipe and dropped into his armchair. She
had either been reflecting deeply upon the
matter, or, as seemed to Mr. Batchel, more
probable, had read something and half forgotten
it. He recalled her questions, and the answers
by which he had vainly tried to lead her to
a more attractive topic. For example:</p>

<div class="blockquo4">
<p>She: Will you tell me why people were buried
at cross roads?</p>

<p>He: Well, consecrated ground was so jealously
guarded that a criminal would be held to
have forfeited the right to be buried
amongst Christian folk. His friends
would therefore choose cross roads where
there was set a wayside cross, and make
his grave at the foot of it. In some of my
journeys in Scotland I have seen crosses....</p></div>

<p>But the young lady had refused to be led
into Scotland. She had stuck to her subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquo4">
<p>She: Why have coffins come back into use?
There is nothing in our Burial Service
about a coffin.</p>

<p>He: True, and the use of the coffin is due, in
part, to an ignorant notion of confining
the corpse, lest, like Hamlet&rsquo;s father, he
should walk the earth. You will have
noticed that the corpse is always carried
out of the house feet foremost, to suggest
a final exit, and that the grave is often
covered with a heavy slab. Very curious
epitaphs are to be found on these slabs....</p>
</div>

<p>But she was not to be drawn into the
subject of epitaphs. She had made him tell of
other devices for confining spirits to their
prison, and securing the peace of the living,
especially of those adopted in the case of violent
and mischievous men. Altogether an unusual
sort of young lady.</p>

<p>The conversation, however, had revived his
memories of what was, after all, a matter of
some interest, and he determined to look
through his parish registers for records of
exceptional burials. He was surprised at himself
for never having done it. He dismissed the
matter from his mind for the time being,
and as it was a bright moonlight night
he thought he would finish his pipe in the
garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore, although midnight was close at
hand, he strolled complacently round his garden,
enjoying the light of the moon no less than in
the daytime he would have enjoyed the sun;
and thus it was that he arrived at the scene of
his labours upon the old rockery. There was
more light than there had been at the end of
the afternoon, and when he had walked up the
bank, and stood over the hole we have already
described, he could distinctly see the few
exposed links of the iron chain. Should he
remove it at once to a place of safety, out of the
way of the gardener? It was about time for
bed. The city clocks were then striking
midnight. He would let the chain decide. If it
came out easily he would remove it; otherwise,
it should remain until morning.</p>

<p>The chain came out more than easily. It
seemed to have a force within itself. He gave
but a slight tug at the free end with a view
of ascertaining what resistance he had to
encounter, and immediately found himself lying
upon his back with the chain in his hand. His
back had fortunately turned towards an elm
three feet away which broke his fall, but there
had been violence enough to cause him no little
surprise.</p>

<p>The effort he had made was so slight that
he could not account for having lost his feet;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and being a careful man, he was a little anxious
about his evening coat, which he was still
wearing. The chain, however, was in his hand,
and he made haste to coil it into a portable
shape, and to return to the house.</p>

<p>Some fifty yards from the spot was the
northern boundary of the garden, a long wall
with a narrow lane beyond. It was not unusual,
even at this hour of the night, to hear footsteps
there. The lane was used by railway men, who
passed to and from their work at all hours, as
also by some who returned late from entertainments
in the neighbouring city.</p>

<p>But Mr. Batchel, as he turned back to the
house, with his chain over one arm, heard more
than footsteps. He heard for a few moments
the unmistakable sound of a scuffle, and then a
piercing cry, loud and sharp, and a noise of
running. It was such a cry as could only have
come from one in urgent need of help.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel dropped his chain. The garden
wall was some ten feet high and he had no
means of scaling it. But he ran quickly into
the house, passed out by the hall door into the
street, and so towards the lane without a
moment&rsquo;s loss of time.</p>

<p>Before he has gone many yards he sees a
man running from the lane with his clothing
in great disorder, and this man, at the sight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Mr. Batchel, darts across the road, runs along in
the shadow of an opposite wall and attempts to
escape.</p>

<p>The man is known well enough to Mr.
Batchel. It is one Stephen Medd, a respectable
and sensible man, by occupation a shunter, and
Mr. Batchel at once calls out to ask what has
happened. Stephen, however, makes no reply
but continues to run along the shadow of the
wall, whereupon Mr. Batchel crosses over and
intercepts him, and again asks what is amiss.
Stephen answers wildly and breathlessly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not going to stop here, let me go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Mr. Batchel lays his hand upon the
man&rsquo;s arm and draws him into the light of the
moon, it is seen that his face is streaming with
blood from a wound near the eye.</p>

<p>He is somewhat calmed by the familiar voice
of Mr. Batchel, and is about to speak, when
another scream is heard from the lane. The
voice is that of a boy or woman, and no sooner
does Stephen hear it than he frees himself
violently from Mr. Batchel and makes away
towards his home. With no less speed does Mr.
Batchel make for the lane, and finds about half
way down a boy lying on the ground wounded
and terrified.</p>

<p>At first the boy clings to the ground, but he,
too, is soon reassured by Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s voice, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
allows himself to be lifted on to his feet. His
wound is also in the face, and Mr. Batchel takes
the boy into his house, bathes and plasters his
wound, and soon restores him to something like
calm. He is what is termed a call-boy, employed
by the Railway Company to awaken drivers at
all hours, and give them their instructions.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel is naturally impatient for the
moment he can question the boy about his
assailant, who is presumably also the assailant
of Stephen Medd. No one had been visible in
the lane, though the moon shone upon it from
end to end. At the first available moment,
therefore, he asks the boy, &ldquo;Who did this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The answer came, without any hesitation,
&ldquo;Nobody.&rdquo; &ldquo;There was nobody there,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and all of a sudden somebody hit me with an
iron thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Mr. Batchel asked, &ldquo;Did you see
Stephen Medd?&rdquo; He was becoming greatly
puzzled.</p>

<p>The boy replied that he had seen Mr. Medd
&ldquo;a good bit in front,&rdquo; with nobody near him,
and that all of a sudden someone knocked him
down.</p>

<p>Further questioning seemed useless. Mr.
Batchel saw the boy to his home, left him at
the door, and returned to bed, but not to
sleep. He could not cease from thinking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and he could think of nothing but assaults
from invisible hands. Morning seemed long
in coming, but came at last.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel was up betimes and made a
very poor breakfast. Dallying with the morning
paper, rather than reading it, his eye was
arrested by a headline about &ldquo;Mysterious
assaults in Elmham.&rdquo; He felt that he had
mysteries of his own to occupy him and was
in no mood to be interested in more assaults.
But he had some knowledge of Elmham, a small
town ten miles distant from Stoneground, and
he read the brief paragraph, which contained no
more than the substance of a telegram. It said,
however, that three persons had been victims
of unaccountable assaults. Two of them had
escaped with slight injuries, but the third,
a young woman, was dangerously wounded,
though still alive and conscious. She declared
that she was quite alone in her house and
had been suddenly struck with great violence
by what felt like a piece of iron, and that
she must have bled to death but for a neighbour
who heard her cries. The neighbour had
at once looked out and seen nobody, but had
bravely gone to her friend&rsquo;s assistance.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel laid down his newspaper
considerably impressed, as was natural, by the
resemblance of these tragedies to what he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
witnessed himself. He was in no condition,
after his excitement and his sleepless night,
to do his usual work. His mind reverted
to the conversation at the dinner party and
the trifle of antiquarian research it had suggested.
Such occupation had often served
him when he found himself suffering from a
cold, or otherwise indisposed for more serious
work. He would get the registers and collect
what entries there might be of irregular burial.</p>

<p>He found only one such entry, but that
one was enough. There was a note dated All
Hallows, 1702, to this effect:</p>

<div class="blockquo1">

<p>&ldquo;This day did a vagrant from Elmham
beat cruelly to death two poor men who
had refused him alms, and upon a hue and
cry being raised, took his own life. He was
buried in one Parson&rsquo;s Close with a stake
through his body and his arms confined
in chains, and stoutly covered in.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>No further news came from Elmham.
Either the effort had been exhausted, or its
purpose achieved. But what could have led
the young lady, a stranger to Mr. Batchel and
to his garden, to hit upon so appropriate a
topic? Mr. Batchel could not answer the
question as he put it to himself again and
again during the day. He only knew that she
had given him a warning, by which, to his shame
and regret, he had been too obtuse to profit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a><br /><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII.<br />

<span class="stl">THE INDIAN LAMP-SHADE.</span></h2>


<p>What has been already said of Mr. Batchel
will have sufficed to inform the reader that he
is a man of very settled habits. The conveniences
of life, which have multiplied so fast
of late, have never attracted him, even when he
has heard of them. Inconveniences to which
he is accustomed have always seemed to him
preferable to conveniences with which he is
unfamiliar. To this day, therefore, he writes
with a quill, winds up his watch with a key, and
will drink no soda-water but from a tumbling
bottle with the cork wired to its neck.</p>

<p>The reader accordingly will learn without
surprise that Mr. Batchel continues to use the
reading-lamp he acquired 30 years ago as a
Freshman in College. He still carries it from
room to room as occasion requires, and ignores
all other means of illumination. It is an
inexpensive lamp of very poor appearance, and
dates from a time when labour-saving was not
yet a fine art. It cannot be lighted without
the removal of several of its parts, and it
is extinguished by the primitive device of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
blowing down the chimney. What has always
shocked the womenfolk of the Batchel family,
however, is the lamp&rsquo;s unworthiness of its
surroundings. Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s house is furnished
in dignified and comfortable style, but the
handsome lamp, surmounting a fluted brazen
column, which his relatives bestowed upon him
at his institution, is still unpacked.</p>

<p>One of his younger and subtler relatives
succeeded in damaging the old lamp, as she
thought, irretrievably, by a well-planned accident,
but found it still in use a year later, most
atrociously repaired. The whole family, and
some outsiders, had conspired to attack the
offending lamp, and it had withstood them all.</p>

<p>The single victory achieved over Mr. Batchel
in this matter is quite recent, and was generally
unexpected. A cousin who had gone out to
India as a bride, and that of Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s
making, had sent him an Indian lamp-shade.
The association was pleasing. The shade was
decorated with Buddhist figures which excited
Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s curiosity, and to the surprise of
all his friends he set it on the lamp and there
allowed it to remain. It was not, however, the
figures which had reconciled him to this novel
and somewhat incongruous addition to the old
lamp. The singular colour of the material had
really attracted him. It was a bright orange-red,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
like no colour he had ever seen, and the
remarks of visitors whose experience of such
things was greater than his own soon justified
him in regarding it as unique. No one had seen
the colour elsewhere; and of all the tints which
have acquired distinctive names, none of the
names could be applied without some further
qualification. Mr. Batchel himself did not
trouble about a name, but was quite certain
that it was a colour that he liked; and more
than that, a colour which had about it some
indescribable fascination. When the lamp had
been brought in, and the curtains drawn, he
used to regard with singular pleasure the
interiors of rooms with whose appearance he
was unaccustomed to concern himself. The
books in his study, and the old-fashioned solid
furniture of his dining room, as reflected in the
new light, seemed to assume a more friendly
aspect, as if they had previously been rigidly
frozen, and had now thawed into life. The
lamp-shade seemed to bestow upon the light
some active property, and gave to the rooms, as
Mr. Batchel said, the appearance of being wide-awake.</p>

<p>These optical effects, as he called them,
were especially noticeable in the dining room,
where the convenience of a large table often
induced him to spend the evening. Standing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
a favourite attitude, with his elbow on the
chimney-piece, Mr. Batchel found increasing
pleasure in contemplating the interior of the
room as he saw it reflected in a large old mirror
above the fireplace. The great mahogany sideboard
across the room, seemed, as he gazed upon
it, to be penetrated by the light, and to acquire
a softness of outline, and a sort of vivacity,
which operated pleasantly upon its owner&rsquo;s
imagination. He found himself playfully regretting,
for example, that the mirror had no
power of recording and reproducing the scenes
enacted before it since the close of the 18th
century, when it had become one of the fixtures
of the house. The ruddy light of the lamp-shade
had always a stimulating effect upon his fancy,
and some of the verses which describe his
visions before the mirror would delight the
reader, but that the author&rsquo;s modesty forbids
their reproduction. Had he been less firm in
this matter we should have inserted here a
poem in which Mr. Batchel audaciously ventured
into the domain of Physics. He endowed his
mirror with the power of retaining indefinitely
the light which fell upon it, and of reflecting it
only when excited by the appropriate stimulus.
The passage beginning</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The mirror, whilst men pass upon their way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Treasures their image for a later day,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">might be derided by students of optics. Mr.
Batchel has often read it in after days, with
amazement, for, when his idle fancies came to
be so gravely substantiated, he found that in
writing the verses he had stumbled upon a new
fact&mdash;a fact based as soundly, as will soon
appear, upon experiment, as those which the
text-books use in arriving at the better-known
properties of reflection.</p>

<p>He was seated in his dining room one frosty
evening in January. His chair was drawn up
to the fire, and the upper part of the space
behind him was visible in the mirror. The
brighter and clearer light thrown down by the
shade was shining upon his book. It is the
fate of most of us to receive visits when we
should best like to be alone, and Mr. Batchel
allowed an impatient exclamation to escape
him, when, at nine o&rsquo;clock on this evening, he
heard the door-bell. A minute later, the boy
announced &ldquo;Mr. Mutcher,&rdquo; and Mr. Batchel,
with such affability as he could hastily assume,
rose to receive the caller. Mr. Mutcher was the
Deputy Provincial Grand Master of the Ancient
Order of Gleaners, and the formality of his
manner accorded with the gravity of his title.
Mr. Batchel soon became aware that the rest
of the evening was doomed. The Deputy Provincial
Grand Master had come to discuss the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
probable effect of the Insurance Act upon
Friendly Societies, of which Mr. Batchel was an
ardent supporter. He attended their meetings,
in some cases kept their accounts, and was
always apt to be consulted in their affairs. He
seated Mr. Mutcher, therefore, in a chair on the
opposite side of the fireplace, and gave him his
somewhat reluctant attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Mr. Mutcher, as he looked
round the room, &ldquo;is a cosy nook on a cold night.
I cordially appreciate your kindness, Reverend
Sir, in affording me this interview, and the comfort
of your apartment leads me to wish that it
might be more protracted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel did his best not to dissent, and
as he settled himself for a long half-hour, began
to watch the rise and fall, between two lines
upon the distant wall-paper of the shadow of
Mr. Mutcher&rsquo;s side-whisker, as it seemed to beat
time to his measured speech.</p>

<p>The D.P.G.M. (for these functionaries are
usually designated by initials) was not a man to
be hurried into brevity. His style had been
studiously acquired at Lodge meetings, and Mr.
Batchel knew it well enough to be prepared for
a lengthy preamble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have presumed,&rdquo; said Mr. Mutcher, as he
looked straight before him into the mirror, &ldquo;to
trespass upon your Reverence&rsquo;s forbearance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
because there are one or two points upon this
new Insurance Act which seem calculated to
damage our long-continued prosperity&mdash;I say
long-continued prosperity,&rdquo; repeated Mr.
Mutcher, as though Mr. Batchel had missed
the phrase. &ldquo;I had the favour of an interview
yesterday,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;with the Sub-Superintendent
of the Perseverance Accident and
General (these were household words in circles
which Mr. Batchel frequented, so that he was at
no loss to understand them), and he was unanimous
with me in agreeing that the matter
called for careful consideration. There are one
or two of our rules which we know to be
essential to the welfare of our Order, and yet
which will have to go by the board&mdash;I say by the
board&mdash;as from July next. Now we are not
Medes, nor yet Persians&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. Mutcher was
about to repeat &ldquo;Persians&rdquo; when he was
observed to look hastily round the room and
then to turn deadly pale. Mr. Batchel rose and
hastened to his support; he was obviously
unwell. The visitor, however, made a strong
effort, rose from his chair at once, saying &ldquo;Pray
allow me to take leave,&rdquo; and hurried to the door
even as he said the words. Mr. Batchel, with
real concern, followed him with the offer of
brandy, or whatever might afford relief. Mr.
Mutcher did not so much as pause to reply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Before Mr. Batchel could reach him he had
crossed the hall, and the door-knob was in his
hand. He thereupon opened the door and
passed into the street without another word.
More unaccountably still, he went away at a
run, such as ill became his somewhat majestic
figure, and Mr. Batchel closed the door and
returned to the dining-room in a state of
bewilderment. He took up his book, and sat
down again in his chair. He did not immediately
begin to read, but set himself to review
Mr. Mutcher&rsquo;s unaccountable behaviour, and
as he raised his eyes to the mirror he saw
an elderly man standing at the sideboard.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel quickly turned round, and as he
did so, recalled the similar movement of his late
visitor. The room was empty. He turned again
to the mirror, and the man was still there&mdash;evidently
a servant&mdash;one would say without
much hesitation, the butler. The cut-away
coat, and white stock, the clean-shaven chin,
and close-trimmed side-whiskers, the deftness
and decorum of his movements were all
characteristic of a respectable family servant,
and he stood at the sideboard like a man who
was at home there.</p>

<p>Another object, just visible above the frame
of the mirror, caused Mr. Batchel to look round
again, and again to see nothing unusual. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
what he saw in the mirror was a square oaken
box some few inches deep, which the butler was
proceeding to unlock. And at this point Mr.
Batchel had the presence of mind to make an
experiment of extraordinary value. He removed,
for a moment, the Indian shade from the lamp,
and laid it upon the table, and thereupon the
mirror showed nothing but empty space and the
frigid lines of the furniture. The butler had
disappeared, as also had the box, to re-appear
the moment the shade was restored to its place.</p>

<p>As soon as the box was opened, the butler
produced a bundled handkerchief which his left
hand had been concealing under the tails of his
coat. With his right hand he removed the
contents of the handkerchief, hurriedly placed
them in the box, closed the lid, and having
done this, left the room at once. His later
movements had been those of a man in fear of
being disturbed. He did not even wait to lock
the box. He seemed to have heard someone
coming.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s interest in the box will subsequently
be explained. As soon as the butler
had left, he stood before the mirror and examined
it carefully. More than once, as he felt the
desire for a closer scrutiny, he turned to the
sideboard itself, where of course no box was to
be seen, and returned to the mirror unreasonably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
disappointed. At length, with the image of the
box firmly impressed upon his memory, he sat
down again in his chair, and reviewed the
butler&rsquo;s conduct, or as he doubted he would have
to call it, misconduct. Unfortunately for Mr.
Batchel, the contents of the handkerchief had
been indistinguishable. But for the butler&rsquo;s
alarm, which caused him to be moving away
from the box even whilst he was placing the
thing within it, the mirror could not have shewn
as much as it did. All that had been made
evident was that the man had something to
conceal, and that it was surreptitiously done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this all?&rdquo; said Mr. Batchel to himself
as he sat looking into the mirror, &ldquo;or is it only
the end of the first Act?&rdquo; The question was, in
a measure, answered by the presence of the box.
That, at all events would have to disappear
before the room could resume its ordinary aspect;
and whether it was to fade out of sight or to be
removed by the butler, Mr. Batchel did not
intend to be looking another way at the time.
He had not seen, although perhaps Mr. Mutcher
had, whether the butler had brought it in, but
he was determined to see whether he took it out.</p>

<p>He had not gazed into the mirror for many
minutes before he learned that there was to be a
second Act. Quite suddenly, a woman was at
the sideboard. She had darted to it, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
time taken in passing over half the length of the
mirror had been altogether too brief to show
what she was like. She now stood with her
face to the sideboard, entirely concealing the
box from view, and all Mr. Batchel could
determine was that she was tall of stature, and
that her hair was raven-black, and not in very
good order. In his anxiety to see her face, he
called aloud, &ldquo;Turn round.&rdquo; Of course, he
understood, when he saw that his cry had been
absolutely without effect, that it had been a
ridiculous thing to do. He turned his head
again for a moment to assure himself that the
room was empty, and to remind himself that
the curtain had fallen, perhaps a century before,
upon the drama&mdash;he began to think of it as a
tragedy&mdash;that he was witnessing. The opportunity,
however, of seeing the woman&rsquo;s features
was not denied him. She turned her face full
upon the mirror&mdash;this is to speak as if we
described the object rather than the image&mdash;so
that Mr. Batchel saw it plainly before him; it
was a handsome, cruel-looking face, of waxen
paleness, with fine, distended, lustrous, eyes.
The woman looked hurriedly round the room,
looked twice towards the door, and then opened
the box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our respectable friend was evidently
observed,&rdquo; said Mr. Batchel. &ldquo;If he has annexed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
anything belonging to this magnificent female,
he is in for a bad quarter of an hour.&rdquo; He
would have given a great deal, for once, to have
had a sideboard backed by a looking glass, and
lamented that the taste of the day had been too
good to tolerate such a thing. He would have
then been able to see what was going on at the
oaken box. As it was, the operations were
concealed by the figure of the woman. She was
evidently busy with her fingers; her elbows,
which shewed plainly enough, were vibrating
with activity. In a few minutes there was a
final movement of the elbows simultaneously
away from her sides, and it shewed, as plainly
as if the hands had been visible, that something
had been plucked asunder. It was just such a
movement as accompanies the removal, after a
struggle, of the close-fitting lid of a canister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What next?&rdquo; said Mr. Batchel, as he
observed the movement, and interpreted it as
the end of the operation at the box. &ldquo;Is this
the end of the second Act?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was soon to learn that it was not the
end, and that the drama of the mirror was
indeed assuming the nature of tragedy. The
woman closed the box and looked towards the
door, as she had done before; then she made as
if she would dart out of the room, and found
her movement suddenly arrested. She stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
dead, and, in a moment, fell loosely to the
ground. Obviously she had swooned away.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel could then see nothing, except
that the box remained in its place on the sideboard,
so that he arose and stood close up to the
mirror in order to obtain a view of the whole
stage, as he called it. It showed him, in the
wider view he now obtained, the woman lying
in a heap upon the carpet, and a grey-wigged
clergyman standing in the doorway of the
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Vicar of Stoneground, without a
doubt,&rdquo; said Mr. Batchel. &ldquo;The household of
my reverend predecessor is not doing well by
him; to judge from the effect of his appearance
upon this female, there&rsquo;s something serious
afoot. Poor old man,&rdquo; he added, as the clergyman
walked into the room.</p>

<p>This expression of pity was evoked by the
Vicar&rsquo;s face. The marks of tears were upon his
cheeks, and he looked weary and ill. He stood
for a while looking down upon the woman who
had swooned away, and then stooped down, and
gently opened her hand.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel would have given a great deal
to know what the Vicar found there. He took
something from her, stood erect for a moment
with an expression of consternation upon his
face; then his chin dropped, his eyes showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
that he had lost consciousness, and he fell to the
ground, very much as the woman had fallen.</p>

<p>The two lay, side by side, just visible in the
space between the table and the sideboard. It
was a curious and pathetic situation. As the
clergyman was about to fall, Mr. Batchel had
turned to save him, and felt a real distress of
helplessness at being reminded again that it
was but an image that he had looked upon. The
two persons now lying upon the carpet had
been for some hundred years beyond human
aid. He could no more help them than he
could help the wounded at Waterloo. He was
tempted to relieve his distress by removing the
shade of the lamp; he had even laid his hand
upon it, but the feeling of curiosity was now
become too strong, and he knew that he must
see the matter to its end.</p>

<p>The woman first began to revive. It was to
be expected, as she had been the first to go. Had
not Mr. Batchel seen her face in the mirror, her
first act of consciousness would have astounded
him. Now it only revolted him. Before she
had sufficiently recovered to raise herself upon
her feet, she forced open the lifeless hands beside
her and snatched away the contents of that
which was not empty; and as she did this, Mr.
Batchel saw the glitter of precious stones. The
woman was soon upon her feet and making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
feebly for the door, at which she paused to leer
at the prostrate figure of the clergyman before
she disappeared into the hall. She appeared
no more, and Mr. Batchel felt glad to be rid
of her presence.</p>

<p>The old Vicar was long in coming to his
senses; as he began to move, there stood in the
doorway the welcome figure of the butler. With
infinite gentleness he raised his master to his
feet, and with a strong arm supported him out
of the room, which at last, stood empty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That, at least,&rdquo; said Mr. Batchel, &ldquo;is the
end of the second Act. I doubt whether I could
have borne much more. If that awful woman
comes back I shall remove the shade and have
done with it all. Otherwise, I shall hope to
learn what becomes of the box, and whether my
respectable friend who has just taken out his
master is, or is not, a rascal.&rdquo; He had been
genuinely moved by what he had seen, and was
conscious of feeling something like exhaustion.
He dare not, however, sit down, lest he should
lose anything important of what remained.
Neither the door nor the lower part of the room
was visible from his chair, so that he remained
standing at the chimney-piece, and there
awaited the disappearance of the oaken box.</p>

<p>So intently were his eyes fixed upon the
box, in which he was especially interested, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
he all but missed the next incident. A velvet
curtain which he could see through the half-closed
door had suggested nothing of interest
to him. He connected it indefinitely, as it was
excusable to do, with the furniture of the house,
and only by inadvertence looked at it a second
time. When, however, it began to travel slowly
along the hall, his curiosity was awakened in a
new direction. The butler, helping his master
out of the room ten minutes since, had left the
door half open, but as the opening was not
towards the mirror, only a strip of the hall
beyond could be seen. Mr. Batchel went to
open the door more widely, only to find, of
course, that the vividness of the images had
again betrayed him. The door of his dining-room
was closed, as he had closed it after Mr.
Mutcher, whose perturbation was now so much
easier to understand.</p>

<p>The curtain continued to move across the
narrow opening, and explained itself in doing
so. It was a pall. The remains it so amply
covered were being carried out of the house to
their resting-place, and were followed by a long
procession of mourners in long cloaks. The
hats they held in their black-gloved hands were
heavily banded with crêpe whose ends descended
to the ground, and foremost among them was
the old clergyman, refusing the support which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
two of the chief mourners were in the act of
proffering. Mr. Batchel, full of sympathy,
watched the whole procession pass the door, and
not until it was evident that the funeral had
left the house did he turn once more to the
box. He felt sure that the closing scene of the
tragedy was at hand, and it proved to be very
near. It was brief and uneventful. The butler
very deliberately entered the room, threw aside
the window-curtains and drew up the blinds,
and then went away at once, taking the box
with him. Mr. Batchel thereupon blew out his
lamp and went to bed, with a purpose of his
own to be fulfilled upon the next day.</p>

<p>His purpose may be stated at once. He had
recognised the oaken box, and knew that it was
still in the house. Three large cupboards in the
old library of Vicar Whitehead were filled with
the papers of a great law-suit about tithe,
dating from the close of the 18th century.
Amongst these, in the last of the three
cupboards, was the box of which so much has
been said. It was filled, so far as Mr. Batchel
remembered, with the assessments for poor&rsquo;s-rate
of a large number of landholders concerned
in the suit, and these Mr. Batchel had never
thought it worth his while to disturb. He had
gone to rest, however, on this night with the
full intention of going carefully through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
contents of the box. He scarcely hoped, after so
long an interval, to discover any clue to the
scenes he had witnessed, but he was determined
at least to make the attempt. If he found
nothing, he intended that the box should
enshrine a faithful record of the transactions in
the dining-room.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that a man who had so
much of the material of a story should spend
a wakeful hour in trying to piece it together.
Mr. Batchel spent considerably more than an
hour in connecting, in this way and that, the
butler and his master, the gypsy-looking
woman, the funeral, but could arrive at no
connexion that satisfied him. Once asleep, he
found the problem easier, and dreamed a
solution so obvious as to make him wonder
that the matter had ever puzzled him. When
he awoke in the morning, also, the defects of
the solution were so obvious as to make him
wonder that he had accepted it; so easily are
we satisfied when reason is not there to
criticise. But there was still the box, and
this Mr. Batchel lifted down from the third
cupboard, dusted with his towel, and when
he was dressed, carried downstairs with him.
His breakfast occupied but a small part of a
large table, and upon the vacant area he was
soon laying, as he examined them, one by one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the documents which the box contained. His
recollection of them proved to be right. They
were overseers&rsquo; lists of parochial assessments,
of which he soon had a score or more laid upon
the table. They were of no interest in themselves,
and did nothing to further the matter
in hand. They would appear to have been
thrust into the box by someone desiring to
find a receptacle for them.</p>

<p>In a little while, however, the character of
the papers changed. Mr. Batchel found himself
reading something of another kind, written
upon paper of another form and colour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Irish bacon to be had of Mr. Broadley,
hop merchant in Southwark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rasin wine is kept at the Wine and
Brandy vaults in Catherine Street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The best hones at Mr. Forsters in Little
Britain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There followed a recipe for a &ldquo;rhumatic
mixture,&rdquo; a way of making a polish for
mahogany, and other such matters. They
were evidently the papers of the butler.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel removed them one by one, as
he had removed the others; household accounts
followed, one or two private letters, and the
advertisement of a lottery, and then he reached
a closed compartment at the bottom of the
box, occupying about half its area. The lid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of the compartment was provided with a bone
stud, and Mr. Batchel lifted it off and laid it
upon the table amongst the papers. He saw
at once what the butler had taken from his
handkerchief. There was an open pocket-knife,
with woeful-looking deposits upon its now rusty
blade. There was a delicate human finger, now
dry and yellow, and on the finger a gold ring.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel took up this latter pitiful object
and removed the ring, even now, not quite
easily. He allowed the finger to drop back into
the box, which he carried away at once into
another room. His appetite for breakfast had
left him, and he rang the bell to have the things
cleared away, whilst he set himself, with the
aid of a lens, to examine the ring.</p>

<p>There had been three large stones, all of
which had been violently removed. The claws
of their settings were, without exception, either
bent outwards, or broken off. Within the ring
was engraved, in graceful italic characters, the
name <strong class="smcap">Amey Lee</strong>, and on the broader part,
behind the place of the stones</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She doth joy double,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And halveth trouble.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This pathetic little love token Mr. Batchel
continued to hold in his hand as he rehearsed
the whole story to which it afforded the clue.
He knew that the ring had been set with such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
stones as there was no mistaking: he remembered
only too well how their discovery had
affected the aged vicar. But never would he
deny himself the satisfaction of hoping that
the old man had been spared the distress of
learning how the ring had been removed.</p>

<p>The name of Amey Lee was as familiar
to Mr. Batchel as his own. Twice at least
every Sunday during the past seven years had
he read it at his feet, as he sat in the chancel,
as well as the name of Robert Lee upon an
adjacent slab, and he had wondered during the
leisurely course of many a meandering hymn
whether there was good precedent for the
spelling of the name. He made another use
now of his knowledge of the pavement. There
was a row of tiles along the head of the slabs,
and Mr. Batchel hastened to fulfil without
delay, what he conceived to be his duty. He
replaced the ring upon Amey Lee&rsquo;s finger and
carried it into the church, and there, having
raised one of the tiles with a chisel, gave it
decent burial.</p>

<p>Whether the butler ever learned that he
had been robbed in his turn, who shall say?
His immediate dismissal, after the funeral,
seemed inevitable, and his oaken box was
evidently placed by him, or by another, where
no man heeded it. It still occupies a place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
amongst the law papers and may lie undisturbed
for another century; and when Mr.
Batchel put it there, without the promised
record of events, he returned to the dining
room, removed the Indian shade from the lamp,
and, having put a lighted match to the edge,
watched it slowly burn away.</p>

<p>Only one thing remained. Mr. Batchel
felt that it would give him some satisfaction
to visit Mr. Mutcher. His address, as obtained
from the District Miscellany of the Order of
Gleaners, was 13, Albert Villas, Williamson
Street, not a mile away from Stoneground.</p>

<p>Mr. Mutcher, fortunately, was at home when
Mr. Batchel called, and indeed opened the door
with a copious apology for being without his coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Mr. Batchel, &ldquo;that you have
overcome your indisposition of last Tuesday
evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it, your Reverence,&rdquo; said
Mr. Mutcher, &ldquo;my wife gave me such a talking
to when I came &rsquo;ome that I was quite ashamed
of myself&mdash;I say ashamed of myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She observed that you were unwell,&rdquo; said
Mr. Batchel, &ldquo;I am sure; but she could hardly
blame you for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time the visitor had been shewn
into the parlour, and Mrs. Mutcher had appeared
to answer for herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I really was ashamed, Sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to
think of the way Mutcher was talking, and a
clergyman&rsquo;s &rsquo;ouse too. Mutcher is not a man,
Sir, that takes anything, not so much as a drop;
but he is wonderful partial to cold pork, which
never does agree with him, and never did, at
night in partic&rsquo;lar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the cold pork, then, that made you
unwell?&rdquo; asked Mr. Batchel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was, your Reverence, and it was not,&rdquo;
Mr. Mutcher replied, &ldquo;for internal discomfort
there was none&mdash;I say none. But a little light-&rsquo;eaded
it did make me, and I could &rsquo;ave
swore, your Reverence, saving your presence,
that I saw an elderly gentleman carry a
box into your room and put it down on the
sheffoneer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was no one there, of course,&rdquo; observed
Mr. Batchel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; replied the D.P.G.M., &ldquo;there was not;
and the discrepancy was too much for me. I
hope you will pardon the abruptness of my
departure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Mr. Batchel, &ldquo;discrepancies
are always embarrassing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you will allow me one day to resume
our discourse upon the subject of National
Insurance,&rdquo; he added, when he shewed his
visitor to the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall not have much leisure,&rdquo; said Mr.
Batchel, audaciously, taking all risks, &ldquo;until the
Greek Kalends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind waiting till it does end,&rdquo;
said Mr. Mutcher, &ldquo;there is no immediate &rsquo;urry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a long time,&rdquo; remarked Mr.
Batchel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t mention it,&rdquo; answered the
Deputy Provincial Grand Master, in his best
manner. &ldquo;But when the time comes, perhaps
you&rsquo;ll drop me a line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank my governors, teachers, spiritual
pastors, and masters,&rdquo; said Wardle, as he lit a
cigar after breakfast, &ldquo;that I never acquired a
taste for that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wardle was a pragmatical and candid friend
who paid Mr. Batchel occasional visits at
Stoneground. He regarded antiquarian tastes
as a form of insanity, and it annoyed him to see
his host poring over registers, churchwardens&rsquo;
accounts, and documents which he contemptuously
alluded to as &ldquo;dirty papers.&rdquo; &ldquo;If
you would throw those things away, Batchel,&rdquo;
he used to say, &ldquo;and read the <cite>Daily Mail</cite>, you&rsquo;d
be a better man for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel replied only with a tolerant
smile, and, as his friend went out of doors with
his cigar, continued to read the document before
him, although it was one he had read twenty
times before. It was an inventory of church
goods, dated the 6th year of Edward <abbr title="6">VI.</abbr>&mdash;to be
exact, the 15th May, 1552. By a royal order
of that year, all Church goods, saving only
what sufficed for the barest necessities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Divine Service, were collected and deposited
in safe hands, there to await further instructions.
The instructions, which had not
been long delayed, had consisted in a curt order
for seizure. Everyone who cares for such
matters, knows and laments the grievous spoliation
of those times.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s document, however, proved
that the Churchwardens of the day were not
incapable of self-defence. They were less
dumb than sheep before the shearers. For,
on the copy of the inventory of which he
had become possessed, was written the Commissioners&rsquo;
Report that &ldquo;at Stoneground did
John Spayn and John Gounthropp, Churchwardens,
declare upon their othes that two
gilded senseres with candellstickes, old paynted
clothes, and other implements, were contayned
in a chest which was robbed on St. Peter&rsquo;s
Eve before the first inventorye made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel had a shrewd suspicion, which
the reader will not improbably share, that John
Spayne and his colleague knew more about
the robbery than they chose to admit. He said
to himself again and again, that the contents of
the chest had been carefully concealed until
times should mend. But from the point of
view of the Churchwardens, times had not
mended. There was evidence that Stoneground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
had been in no mood to tolerate censers in the
reign of Mary, and it seemed unlikely that any
later time could have re-admitted the ancient
ritual. On this account, Mr. Batchel had never
ceased to believe that the contents of the chest
lay somewhere near at hand, nor to hope that
it might be his lot to discover it.</p>

<p>Whenever there was any work of the nature
of excavation or demolition within a hundred
yards of the Church, Mr. Batchel was sure to
be there. His presence was very distasteful in
most cases, to the workmen engaged, whom
it deprived of many intervals of leisure to which
they were accustomed when left alone. During
a long course of operations connected with
the restoration of the Church, Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s
vigilance had been of great advantage to the
work, both in raising the standard of industry
and in securing attention to details which the
builders were quite prepared to overlook. It
had, however, brought him no nearer to the
censers and other contents of the chest, and
when the work was completed, his hopes of
discovery had become pitifully slender.</p>

<p>Mr. Wardle, notwithstanding his general
contempt for antiquarian pursuits, was polite
enough to give Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s hobbies an
occasional place in their conversation, and
in this way was informed of the &ldquo;stolen&rdquo; goods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
The information, however, gave him no more
than a very languid interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you let the things alone?&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the use of them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel felt it all but impossible to
answer a man who could say this; yet he made
the attempt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The historic interest,&rdquo; he said seriously,
&ldquo;of censers that were used down to the days
of Edward <abbr title="6">VI.</abbr> is in itself sufficient to justify&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Etcetera,&rdquo; said his friend, interrupting the
sentence which even Mr. Batchel was not sure
of finishing to his satisfaction, &ldquo;but it takes
so little to justify you antiquarians, with your
axes and hammers. What can you do with it
when you get it, if you ever do get it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are two censers,&rdquo; Mr. Batchel
mildly observed in correction, &ldquo;and other
things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Wardle; &ldquo;tell me about
one of them, and leave me to do the multiplication.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this permission, Mr. Batchel entered
upon a general description of such ancient
thuribles as he knew of, and Wardle heard him
with growing impatience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; he burst in at length,
&ldquo;that what you are making all this pother
about is a sort of silver cruet-stand, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
thin metal to begin with, and cleaned down
to the thickness of egg-shell before the Commissioners
heard of it. At this moment, if it
exists, it is a handful of black scrap. If
you found it, I wouldn&rsquo;t give a shilling for it;
and if I would, it isn&rsquo;t yours to sell. Why can&rsquo;t
you let the things alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the interest of it,&rdquo; said Mr. Batchel,
&ldquo;is what attracts me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity you can&rsquo;t take an interest in
something less uninteresting,&rdquo; said Wardle,
petulantly; &ldquo;but let me tell you what I think
about your censers and all the rest of it. Your
Churchwardens lied about them, but that&rsquo;s all
right; I&rsquo;d have done the same myself. If their
things couldn&rsquo;t be used, they were not going to
have them abused, so they put them safely out
of the way, your&rsquo;s and everybody&rsquo;s else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was not proposing to abuse them,&rdquo; interrupted
Mr. Batchel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you proposing to use them?&rdquo;
rejoined Wardle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one thing or the other,
to my mind. There are people who dig out
Bishops and steal their rings to put in glass
cases, but I don&rsquo;t know how they square the
police; and it&rsquo;s the same sort of thing you seem
to be up to. Let the things alone. You&rsquo;re a
Prayer Book man, and just the sort the Churchwardens
couldn&rsquo;t stomach. You talk fast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
enough at the Dissenters because they want to
collar your property now. Why can&rsquo;t you do as
you would be done by?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel thought it useless to say any
more to a man in so unsympathetic an attitude,
or to enter upon any defence of the antiquarian
researches to which his friend had so crudely
referred. He did not much like, however, to be
anticipated in a theory of the &ldquo;robbery&rdquo; which
he felt to be reasonable and probable. He had
hoped to propound the same theory himself, and
to receive a suitable compliment upon his
penetration. He began, therefore, somewhat
irritably, to make the most of conjectures
which, at various times, had occurred to him.
&ldquo;Men of that sort,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;would have disposed
of the censers to some one who could go on
using them, and in that case they are not here
at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men of that sort,&rdquo; answered Wardle, &ldquo;are
as careful of their skins as men of any other
sort, and besides that, your Stoneground men
have a very good notion of sticking to what they
have got. The things are here, I daresay, if
they are anywhere; but they are not yours, and
you have no business to meddle with them. If
you would spend your time in something else
than poking about after other people&rsquo;s things,
you&rsquo;d get better value for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>This brief conversation, in which Mr.
Batchel had scarcely been allowed the part to
which he felt entitled, was in one respect
satisfactory. It supported his belief that the
censers lay somewhere within reach. In other
respects, however, the attitude of Wardle was
intolerable. He was evidently out of all
sympathy with the quest upon which Mr.
Batchel was set, and, for their different reasons,
each was glad to drop the subject.</p>

<p>During the next two or three days, the
matter of the censers was not referred to, if only
for lack of opportunity. Wardle was a kind of
visitor for whom there was always a welcome at
Stoneground, and the welcome was in his case
no less cordial on account of his brutal frankness
of expression, which, on the whole, his host
enjoyed. His pungent criticisms of other men
were vastly entertaining to Mr. Batchel, who
was not so unreasonable as to feel aggrieved at
an occasional attack upon himself.</p>

<p>A guest of this unceremonious sort makes
but small demands upon his host. Mr. Wardle
used to occupy himself contentedly and unobtrusively
in the house or in the garden whilst his
host followed his usual avocations. The two men
met at meals, and liked each other none the less
because they were apart at most other times. A
great part of Mr. Wardle&rsquo;s day was passed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
company of the gardener, to whose talk his own
master was but an indifferent listener. The
visitor and the gardener were both lovers of the
soil, and taught each other a great deal as they
worked side by side. Mr. Wardle found that
sort of exercise wholesome, and, as the gardener
expressed it, &ldquo;was not frit to take his coat off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gardening operations at this time of
year were such as Mr. Wardle liked. The
over-crowded shrubberies were being thinned,
and a score or so of young shrubs had to be
moved into better quarters. Upon a certain
morning, when Mr. Batchel was occupied in his
study, some aucubas were being transplanted
into a strip of ground in front of the house, and
Wardle had undertaken the task of digging
holes to receive them. It was this task that he
suddenly interrupted in order to burst in upon
his host in what seemed to the latter a repulsive
state of dirt and perspiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Talk of discoveries,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;come and
see what I&rsquo;ve found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the censers, I suppose,&rdquo; said Mr.
Batchel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Censers be hanged,&rdquo; said Wardle, &ldquo;come
and look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel laid down his pen, with a sigh,
and followed Wardle to the front of the house.
His guest had made three large holes, each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
about two feet square, and drawing Mr. Batchel
to the nearest of them, said &ldquo;Look there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel looked. He saw nothing, and
said so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo; exclaimed Wardle with impatience.
&ldquo;You see the bottom of the hole, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This Mr. Batchel admitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Wardle, &ldquo;kindly look and see
whether you cannot see something else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is apparently a cylindrical object
lying across the angle of your excavation,&rdquo; said
Mr. Batchel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; replied his guest, &ldquo;is what you are
pleased to call nothing. Let me inform you
that the cylindrical object is a piece of thick
lead pipe, and that the pipe runs along the
whole front of your house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gas-pipe, no doubt,&rdquo; said Mr. Batchel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any gas within a mile of this
place?&rdquo; asked Wardle.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel admitted that there was not,
and felt that he had made a needlessly foolish
suggestion. He felt safer in the amended
suggestion that the object was a water-pipe.</p>

<p>An ironical cross-examination by Mr.
Wardle disposed of the amended suggestion as
completely as he had disposed of the other, and
his host began to grow restive. &ldquo;If this sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
discovery pleases you,&rdquo; he said testily, &ldquo;I will
not grudge you your pleasure, but, to quote
your own words, why can&rsquo;t you let it alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any idea,&rdquo; said Mr. Wardle, &ldquo;of
the value of this length of piping, at the present
price of lead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even Mr. Wardle could hardly have suspected
his host of knowing anything so preposterous
as the price of lead, but he felt himself
ill-used when Mr. Batchel disclaimed any
interest in the matter, and returned to his
study.</p>

<p>Wardle had a commercial mind, which
elsewhere was the means of securing him a
very satisfactory income, and on this account,
his host, as he resumed his work indoors, excused
what he regarded as a needless interruption.</p>

<p>He little suspected that his friend&rsquo;s commercial
mind was to do him the great service of
putting him in possession of the censers, and
then to do him a disservice even greater.</p>

<p>Had any such connexion so much as
suggested itself, Mr. Batchel would more
willingly have answered to the summons which
came an hour later, when the gardener appeared
at the window of the study, evidently bursting
with information. When he had succeeded in
attracting his master&rsquo;s attention, and drawn
him away from his desk, it was to say that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
whole length of pipe had been uncovered, and
found to issue from a well on the south side
of the house.</p>

<p>The discovery was at least unexpected, and
Mr. Batchel went out, even if somewhat grudgingly,
to look at the place. He came upon the
well, close by the window of his dining-room.
It had been covered by a stone slab, now partially
removed. The narrow trench which Wardle
and the gardener had made in order to expose
the pipe, extended eastwards to the corner of
the house, and thence along the whole length of
the front, probably to serve a pump on the
north side, where lay the yard and stables. The
pipe itself, Mr. Wardle&rsquo;s prize, had been withdrawn,
and there remained only a rusted chain
which passed from some anchorage beneath the
soil, over the lip of the well. Mr. Batchel
inferred that it had carried, and perhaps carried
still, the bucket of former times, and stooped
down to see whether he could draw it up. He
heard, far below, the light splash of the soil
disturbed by his hands; but before he could
grasp the chain, he felt himself seized by the
waist and held back.</p>

<p>The exaggerated attentions of his gardener
had often annoyed Mr. Batchel. He was not
allowed even to climb a short ladder without
having to submit to absurd precautions for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
safety, and he would have been much better
pleased to have more respect paid to his intelligence,
and less to his person. In the present
instance, the precaution seemed so unnecessary
that he turned about angrily to protest, both
against the interference with his movements,
and the unseemly force used.</p>

<p>It was at this point that he made a disquieting
discovery. He was standing quite alone.
The gardener and Mr. Wardle were both on
the north side of the house, dealing with the
only thing they cared about&mdash;the lead pipe.
Mr. Batchel made no further attempt to move
the chain; he was, in fact, in some bodily
fear, and he returned to his study by the
way he had come, in a disordered condition of
mind.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, when the gong sounded
for luncheon, he was slowly making his
way into the dining-room, when he encountered
his guest running downstairs from his room,
in great spirits. &ldquo;A trifle over two hundredweight!&rdquo;
he exclaimed, as he reached the
foot of the staircase, and seemed disappointed
that Mr. Batchel did not immediately shake
hands with him upon so fine a result of the
morning&rsquo;s work. Mr. Batchel, needless to say,
was occupied with other recollections.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is unnecessary to ask,&rdquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
he to his guest as he proceeded to carve a
chicken, &ldquo;whether you believe in ghosts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; said Wardle promptly, &ldquo;why
should I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Mr. Batchel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve had the advantage of a
commercial education,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;instead
of learning dead languages and soaking my mind
in heathen fables.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel winced at this disrespectful
allusion to the University education of which
he was justly proud. He wanted an opinion,
however, and the conversation had to go on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your commercial education,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;allows you, I daresay, to know what is meant
by a hypothetical case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make it one,&rdquo; said Wardle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Assuming a ghost, then, would it be
capable of exerting force upon a material body?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose?&rdquo; asked Wardle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you insist upon making it a personal
matter,&rdquo; replied Mr. Batchel, &ldquo;let us say mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me have the particulars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In reply to this, Mr. Batchel related his
experience at the well.</p>

<p>Mr. Wardle merely said &ldquo;Pass the salt, I
need it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Undeterred by the scepticism of his friend,
Mr. Batchel pressed the point, and upon that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Mr. Wardle closed the conversation by observing
that since, by hypothesis, ghosts could clank
chains, and ring bells, he was bound to suppose
them capable of doing any silly thing they chose.
&ldquo;A month in the City, Batchel,&rdquo; he gravely
added, &ldquo;would do you a world of good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as the meal was over, Mr. Wardle
went back to his gardening, whilst his host
betook himself to occupations more suited to
his tranquil habits. The two did not meet again
until dinner; and during that meal, and after it,
the conversation turned wholly upon politics,
Mr. Wardle being congenially occupied until
bed-time in demonstrating that the politics of
his host had been obsolete for three-quarters of a
century. His outdoor exercise, followed by an
excellent dinner, had disposed him to retire
early; he rose from his chair soon after ten.
&ldquo;There is one thing,&rdquo; he pleasantly remarked to
his host, &ldquo;that I am bound to say in favour of
a University education; it has given you a fine
taste in victuals.&rdquo; With this compliment, he
said &ldquo;good-night,&rdquo; and went up to bed.</p>

<p>Mr. Batchel himself, as the reader knows,
kept later hours. There were few nights upon
which he omitted to take his walk round the
garden when the world had grown quiet, even
in unfavourable weather. It was far from
favourable upon the present occasion; there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
was but little moon, and a light rain was falling.
He determined, however, to take at least one
turn round, and calling his terrier Punch from
the kitchen, where he lay in his basket, Mr.
Batchel went out, with the dog at his heel.
He carried, as his custom was, a little electric
lamp, by whose aid he liked to peep into birds&rsquo;
nests, and make raids upon slugs and other pests.</p>

<p>They had hardly set out upon their walk
when Punch began to show signs of uneasiness.
Instead of running to and fro, with his nose to
the ground, as he ordinarily did, the terrier
remained whining in the rear. Shortly, they
came upon a hedgehog lying coiled up in the
path; it was a find which the dog was wont to
regard as a rare piece of luck, and to assail with
delirious enjoyment. Now, for some reason,
Punch refused to notice it, and, when it was
illuminated for his especial benefit, turned his
back upon it and looked up, in a dejected
attitude, at his master. The behaviour of the
dog was altogether unnatural, and Mr. Batchel
occupied himself, as they passed on, in trying to
account for it, with the animal still whining at
his heel. They soon reached the head of the
little path which descended to the Lode, and
there Mr. Batchel found a much harder problem
awaiting him, for at the other end of the path
he distinctly saw the outline of a boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>There had been no boat on the Lode for
twenty years. Just so long ago the drainage
of the district had required that the main
sewer should cross the stream at a point some
hundred yards below the Vicar&rsquo;s boundary fence.
There, ever since, a great pipe three feet in
diameter had obstructed the passage. It lay
just at the level of the water, and effectually
closed it to all traffic. Mr. Batchel knew that
no boat could pass the place, and that none
survived in the parts above it. Yet here was a
boat drawn up at the edge of his garden. He
looked at it intently for a minute or so, and had
no difficulty in making out the form of such
a boat as was in common use all over the Fen
country&mdash;a wide flat-bottomed boat, lying low
in the water. The &ldquo;sprit&rdquo; used for punting it
along lay projecting over the stern. There was
no accounting for such a boat being there: Mr.
Batchel did not understand how it possibly
could be there, and for a while was disposed to
doubt whether it actually was. The great
drain-pipe was so perfect a defence against
intrusion of the kind that no boat had ever
passed it. The Lode, when its water was low
enough to let a boat go under the pipe, was not
deep enough to float it, or wide enough to
contain it. Upon this occasion the water was
high, and the pipe half submerged, forming an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
insuperable obstacle. Yet there lay, unmistakeably,
a boat, within ten yards of the place
where Mr. Batchel stood trying to account
for it.</p>

<p>These ten yards, unfortunately, were impassable.
The slope down to the water&rsquo;s edge
had to be warily trodden even in dry weather.
It was steep and treacherous. After rain it
afforded no foothold whatever, and to attempt
a descent in the darkness would have been to
court disaster. After examining the boat again,
therefore, by the light of his little lamp, Mr.
Batchel proceeded upon his walk, leaving the
matter to be investigated by daylight.</p>

<p>The events of this memorable night, however,
were but beginning. As he turned from
the boat his eye was caught by a white streak
upon the ground before him, which extended
itself into the darkness and disappeared. It
was Punch, in veritable panic, making for home,
across flower-beds and other places he well
knew to be out of bounds. The whistle he had
been trained to obey had no effect upon his
flight; he made a lightning dash for the house.
Mr. Batchel could not help regretting that
Wardle was not there to see. His friend held
the coursing powers of Punch in great contempt,
and was wont to criticise the dog in sporting
jargon, whose terms lay beyond the limits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s vocabulary, but whose general
drift was as obvious as it was irritating. The
present performance, nevertheless, was so exceptional
that it soon began to connect itself
in Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s mind with the unnatural
conduct to which we have already alluded. It
was somehow proving to be an uncomfortable
night, and as Mr. Batchel felt the rain increasing
to a steady drizzle he decided to abandon
his walk and to return to the house by the way
he had come.</p>

<p>He had already passed some little distance
beyond the little path which descended to the
Lode. The main path by which he had come
was of course behind him, until he turned
about to retrace his steps.</p>

<p>It was at the moment of turning that he had
ocular demonstration of the fact that the boat
had brought passengers. Not twenty yards in
front of him, making their way to the water,
were two men carrying some kind of burden.
They had reached an open space in the path,
and their forms were quite distinct: they were
unusually tall men; one of them was gigantic.
Mr. Batchel had little doubt of their being
garden thieves. Burglars, if there had been
anything in the house to attract them,
could have found much easier ways of removing
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>No man, even if deficient in physical
courage, can see his property carried away
before his eyes and make no effort to detain
it. Mr. Batchel was annoyed at the desertion
of his terrier, who might at least have
embarrassed the thieves&rsquo; retreat; meanwhile
he called loudly upon the men to stand, and
turned upon them the feeble light of his lamp.
In so doing he threw a new light not only
upon the trespassers, but upon the whole
transaction. No response was made to his
challenge, but the men turned away their faces
as if to avoid recognition, and Mr. Batchel saw
that the nearest of them, a burly, square-headed
man in a cassock, was wearing the
tonsure. He described it as looking, in the dim,
steely light of the lamp, like a crown-piece on
a door-mat. Both the men, when they found
themselves intercepted, hastened to deposit
their burden upon the ground, and made for
the boat. The burden fell upon the ground
with a thud, but the bearers made no sound.
They skimmed down to the Lode without seeming
to tread, entered the boat in perfect silence,
and shoved it off without sound or splash. It
has already been explained that Mr. Batchel
was unable to descend to the water&rsquo;s edge. He
ran, however, to a point of the garden which
the boat must inevitably pass, and reached it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
just in time. The boat was moving swiftly
away, and still in perfect silence. The beams
of the pocket-lamp just sufficed to reach it, and
afforded a parting glimpse of the tonsured
giant as he gave a long shove with the sprit,
and carried the boat out of sight. It shot
towards the drain-pipe, then not forty yards
ahead, but the men were travelling as men
who knew their way to be clear.</p>

<p>It was by this time evident, of course, that
these were no garden-thieves. The aspect of
the men, and the manner of their disappearance,
had given a new complexion to the adventure.
Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s heart was in his mouth, but his
mind was back in the 16th century; and having
stood still for some minutes in order to regain
his composure, he returned to the path, with a
view of finding out what the men had left
behind.</p>

<p>The burden lay in the middle of the path,
and the lamp was once more brought into
requisition. It revealed a wooden box, covered
in most parts with moss, and all glistening with
moisture. The wood was so far decayed that
Mr. Batchel had hopes of forcing open the box
with his hands; so wet and slimy was it,
however, that he could obtain no hold, and he
hastened to the house to procure some kind of
tool. Near to the cupboard in which such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
things were kept was the sleeping-basket of the
dog, who was closely curled inside it, and
shivering violently. His master made an
attempt to take him back into the garden; it
would be useful, he thought, to have warning in
case the boat should return. The prospect of
being surprised by these large, noiseless men
was not one to be regarded with comfort.
Punch, however, who was usually so eager for
an excursion, was now in such distress at being
summoned that his master felt it cruel to
persist. Having found a chisel, therefore, he
returned to the garden alone. The box lay
undisturbed where he had left it, and in two
minutes was standing open.</p>

<p>The reader will hardly need to be told what
it contained. At the bottom lay some heavy
articles which Mr. Batchel did not disturb. He
saw the bases of two candlesticks. He had tried
to lift the box, as it lay, by means of a chain
passing through two handles in the sides, but
had found it too heavy. It was by this chain
that the men had been carrying it. The heavier
articles, therefore, he determined to leave where
they were until morning. His interest in them
was small compared with that which the other
contents of the box had excited, for on the top
of these articles was folded &ldquo;a paynted cloth,&rdquo;
and upon this lay the two gilded censers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the discovery Mr. Batchel had
dreamed of for years. His excitement hardly
allowed him to think of the strange manner in
which it had been made. He glanced nervously
around him to see whether there might be any
sign of the occupants of the boat, and, seeing
nothing, he placed his broad-brimmed hat upon
the ground, carefully laid in it the two censers,
closed the box again, and carried his treasure
delicately into the house. The occurrences of
the last hour have not occupied long in the
telling; they occupied much longer in the
happening. It was now past midnight, and Mr.
Batchel, after making fast the house, went at
once upstairs, carrying with him the hat and its
precious contents, just as he had brought it
from the garden. The censers were not exactly
&ldquo;black-scrap,&rdquo; as Mr. Wardle had anticipated, or
pretended to anticipate, but they were much
discoloured, and very fragile. He spread a clean
handkerchief upon the chest of drawers in his
bedroom, and, removing the vessels with the
utmost care, laid them upon it. Then after
spending some minutes in admiration of their
singularly beautiful form and workmanship, he
could not deny himself the pleasure of calling
Wardle to look.</p>

<p>The guest-room was close at hand. Mr.
Wardle, having been already disturbed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
locking up of the house, was fully awakened by
the entrance of his host into the room with a
candle in his hand. The look of excitement on
Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s face could not escape the observation
even of a man still yawning, and Mr.
Wardle at once exclaimed &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have got them,&rdquo; said Mr. Batchel, in a
hushed voice.</p>

<p>His guest, who had forgotten all about the
censers, began by interpreting &ldquo;them&rdquo; to mean
a nervous disorder that is plural by nature, and
so was full of sympathy and counsel. When,
however, his host had made him understand the
facts, he became merely impatient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come and look?&rdquo; said Mr.
Batchel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; said Wardle, &ldquo;I shall do where I
am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are in excellent preservation,&rdquo; said
Mr. Batchel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then they will keep till morning,&rdquo; was the
answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But just come and tell me what you think
of them,&rdquo; said Mr. Batchel, making a last
attempt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could tell you what I think of them,&rdquo;
answered Wardle, &ldquo;without leaving my bed,
which I have no intention of leaving; but I have
to leave Stoneground to-morrow, and I don&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
want to hurt your feelings, so &lsquo;Good-night.&rsquo;&rdquo;
Upon this, he turned over in bed and gave a
loud snore, which Mr. Batchel accepted as a
manifesto. He has never ceased to regret that
he did not compel his guest to see the censers,
but he did not then foresee the sore need he
would have of a witness. He answered his
friend&rsquo;s good-night, and returned to his own
room. Once more he admired the two censers
as their graceful outlines stood out, sharp and
clear, against the white handkerchief, and having
done this, he was soon in bed and asleep.
To the men in the boat he had not given
another thought, since he became possessed of
the box they had left behind; of the other
contents of the box he had thought as little,
since he had secured the chief treasures of
which he had been so long in search.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Wardle, when he arose in the
morning, felt somewhat ashamed of his surliness
of the preceding night. His repudiation of all
interest in the censers had not been quite
sincere, for beneath his affectation of unconcern
there lay a genuine curiosity about his friend&rsquo;s
discovery. Before he had finished dressing,
therefore, he crossed over into Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s
room. The censers, to his surprise, were nowhere
to be seen. His host, less to his surprise,
was still fast asleep. Mr. Wardle opened the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
drawers, one by one, in search of the censers,
but the drawers proved to be all quite full
of clothing. He looked with no more success
into every other place where they might have
been bestowed. His mind was always ready
with a grotesque idea, &ldquo;Blest if he hasn&rsquo;t
taken them to bed with him,&rdquo; he said aloud,
and at the sound of his voice Mr. Batchel
awoke.</p>

<p>His eyes, as soon as they were open, turned
to the chest of drawers; and what he saw there,
or rather, what he failed to see, caused him,
without more ado, to leap out of bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you done with them?&rdquo; he cried
out.</p>

<p>The serious alarm of Mr. Batchel was so
evident as to check the facetious reply which
Wardle was about to frame. He contented
himself with saying that he had not touched or
seen the things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; again cried Mr. Batchel,
ignoring the disclaimer. &ldquo;You ought not to
have touched them, they will not bear handling.
Where are they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Wardle turned away in disgust. &ldquo;I
expect,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re where they&rsquo;ve been
this three hundred and fifty years.&rdquo; Upon that
he returned to his room, and went on with his
dressing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Batchel immediately followed him, and
looked eagerly round the room. He proceeded
to open drawers, and to search, in a frenzied
manner, in every possible, and in many an
impossible, place of concealment. His distress
was so patent that his friend soon ceased to
trifle with it. By a few minutes serious conversation
he made it clear that there had been
no practical joking, and Mr. Batchel returned to
his room in tears. &ldquo;Look here, Batchel,&rdquo; said
Mr. Wardle as he left, &ldquo;you want a holiday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Within a few minutes Mr. Batchel returned
fully dressed. &ldquo;You seem to think, Wardle,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;that I have been dreaming about these
censers. Come out into the garden and let me
shew you the box and the other things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Wardle was quite willing to assent to
anything, if only out of pity, and the two went
together into the garden, Mr. Batchel leading
the way. Going at a great pace, they soon came
to the path upon which the box had lain. The
marks it had left upon the soft gravel were
plain enough, and Mr. Batchel eagerly appealed
to his friend to notice them. Of the box and
its contents, however, there was no other trace.
The whole adventure was described&mdash;the strange
behaviour and subsequent flight of the terrier&mdash;the
men with averted faces&mdash;the boat&mdash;and
the opening of the box. Mr. Batchel tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
shake the obvious incredulity of his guest by
pointing to the chisel which still lay beside
the path. Mr. Wardle only replied, &ldquo;You want
a holiday, Batchel! Let&rsquo;s go in to breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Breakfast on that morning was not the
cheerful meal it was wont to be. During the few
minutes of waiting for it Mr. Batchel stood
at the window of his dining-room looking out
upon the site of the well which the gardener
had now covered in. He rehearsed the whole
of the adventure from first to last, wondering
whether the new place of safety would ever
be discovered. But he said no more to his
guest; his heart was too full.</p>

<p>The two breakfasted almost in silence,
and the meal was scarcely over when the cab
arrived to take Mr. Wardle to his train. Mr.
Batchel bade him farewell, and saw him depart
with genuine regret; he was returning sadly
into the house when he heard his name called.
It was Wardle, leaning out of the window of his
cab as it drove away, and waving his hand,
&ldquo;Batchel,&rdquo; he cried again, &ldquo;mind you take a
holiday.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX.<br />

<span class="stl">THE KIRK SPOOK.</span></h2>


<p>Before many years have passed it will be
hard to find a person who has ever seen a Parish
Clerk. The Parish Clerk is all but extinct. Our
grandfathers knew him well&mdash;an oldish, clean-shaven
man, who looked as if he had never been
young, who dressed in rusty black, bestowed
upon him, as often as not, by the Rector, and
who usually wore a white tie on Sundays, out of
respect for the seriousness of his office. He it
was who laid out the Rector&rsquo;s robes, and helped
him to put them on; who found the places in
the large Bible and Prayer Book, and indicated
them by means of decorous silken bookmarkers;
who lighted and snuffed the candles
in the pulpit and desk, and attended to the little
stove in the squire&rsquo;s pew; who ran busily about,
in short, during the quarter-hour which preceded
Divine Service, doing a hundred little things,
with all the activity, and much of the appearance,
of a beetle.</p>

<p>Just such a one was Caleb Dean, who was
Clerk of Stoneground in the days of William IV.
Small in stature, he possessed a voice which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Nature seemed to have meant for a giant, and in
the discharge of his duties he had a dignity of
manner disproportionate even to his voice. No
one was afraid to sing when he led the Psalm, so
certain was it that no other voice could be
noticed, and the gracious condescension with
which he received his meagre fees would have been
ample acknowledgment of double their amount.</p>

<p>Man, however, cannot live by dignity alone,
and Caleb was glad enough to be sexton as well
as clerk, and to undertake any other duties by
which he might add to his modest income. He
kept the Churchyard tidy, trimmed the lamps,
chimed the bells, taught the choir their simple
tunes, turned the barrel of the organ, and
managed the stoves.</p>

<p>It was this last duty in particular, which
took him into Church &ldquo;last thing,&rdquo; as he used
to call it, on Saturday night. There were people
in those days, and may be some in these, whom
nothing would induce to enter a Church at midnight;
Caleb, however, was so much at home
there that all hours were alike to him. He was
never an early man on Saturdays. His wife,
who insisted upon sitting up for him, would
often knit her way into Sunday before he
appeared, and even then would find it hard to
get him to bed. Caleb, in fact, when off duty,
was a genial little fellow; he had many friends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
and on Saturday evenings he knew where to
find them.</p>

<p>It was not, therefore, until the evening was
spent that he went to make up his fires; and his
voice, which served for other singing than that
of Psalms, could usually be heard, within a little
of midnight, beguiling the way to Church with
snatches of convivial songs. Many a belated
traveller, homeward bound, would envy him his
spirits, but no one envied him his duties. Even
such as walked with him to the neighbourhood
of the Churchyard would bid him &ldquo;Good night&rdquo;
whilst still a long way from the gate. They
would see him disappear into the gloom
amongst the graves, and shudder as they
turned homewards.</p>

<p>Caleb, meanwhile, was perfectly content.
He knew every stone in the path; long practice
enabled him, even on the darkest night, to
thrust his huge key into the lock at the first
attempt, and on the night we are about to
describe&mdash;it had come to Mr. Batchel from an
old man who heard it from Caleb&rsquo;s lips&mdash;he
did it with a feeling of unusual cheerfulness
and contentment.</p>

<p>Caleb always locked himself in. A prank
had once been played upon him, which had
greatly wounded his dignity; and though it had
been no midnight prank, he had taken care, ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
since, to have the Church to himself. He locked
the door, therefore, as usual, on the night we
speak of, and made his way to the stove. He
used no candle. He opened the little iron door
of the stove, and obtained sufficient light to
shew him the fuel he had laid in readiness; then,
when he had made up his fire, he closed this
door again, and left the Church in darkness. He
never could say what induced him upon this
occasion to remain there after his task was
done. He knew that his wife was sitting up, as
usual, and that, as usual, he would have to hear
what she had to say. Yet, instead of making
his way home, he sat down in the corner of the
nearest seat. He supposed that he must have
felt tired, but had no distinct recollection of it.</p>

<p>The Church was not absolutely dark. Caleb
remembered that he could make out the outlines
of the windows, and that through the window
nearest to him he saw a few stars. After his
eyes had grown accustomed to the gloom he
could see the lines of the seats taking shape in
the darkness, and he had not long sat there
before he could dimly see everything there was.
At last he began to distinguish where books lay
upon the shelf in front of him. And then he
closed his eyes. He does not admit having
fallen asleep, even for a moment. But the seat
was restful, the neighbouring stove was growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
warm, he had been through a long and joyous
evening, and it was natural that he should at
least close his eyes.</p>

<p>He insisted that it was only for a moment.
Something, he could not say what, caused him
to open his eyes again immediately. The
closing of them seemed to have improved what
may be called his dark sight. He saw everything
in the Church quite distinctly, in a sort
of grey light. The pulpit stood out, large and
bulky, in front. Beyond that, he passed his eyes
along the four windows on the north side of the
Church. He looked again at the stars, still
visible through the nearest window on his left
hand as he was sitting. From that, his eyes fell
to the further end of the seat in front of him,
where he could even see a faint gleam of
polished wood. He traced this gleam to the
middle of the seat, until it disappeared in black
shadow, and upon that his eye passed on to the
seat he was in, and there he saw a man sitting
beside him.</p>

<p>Caleb described the man very clearly. He
was, he said, a pale, old-fashioned looking man,
with something very churchy about him.
Reasoning also with great clearness, he said
that the stranger had not come into the Church
either with him or after him, and that therefore
he must have been there before him. And in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
that case, seeing that the Church had been
locked since two in the afternoon, the
stranger must have been there for a considerable
time.</p>

<p>Caleb was puzzled; turning therefore, to
the stranger, he asked, &ldquo;How long have you
been here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger answered at once, &ldquo;Six hundred
years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! come!&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come where?&rdquo; said the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you come to that, come out,&rdquo; said
Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could,&rdquo; said the stranger, and
heaved a great sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to prevent you?&rdquo; said Caleb.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the door, and here&rsquo;s the key.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; said Caleb. &ldquo;Come
along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that he proceeded to take the
stranger by the sleeve, and then it was that
he says you might have knocked him down
with a feather. His hand went right into the
place where the sleeve seemed to be, and Caleb
distinctly saw two of the stranger&rsquo;s buttons
on the top of his own knuckles.</p>

<p>He hastily withdrew his hand, which began
to feel icy cold, and sat still, not knowing what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
to say next. He found that the stranger was
gently chuckling with laughter, and this
annoyed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; he enquired
peevishly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not funny enough for two,&rdquo; answered
the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you, anyhow?&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the kirk spook,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>

<p>Now Caleb had not the least notion what
a &ldquo;kirk spook&rdquo; was. He was not willing to
admit his ignorance, but his curiosity was too
much for his pride, and he asked for information.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every Church has a spook,&rdquo; said the
stranger, &ldquo;and I am the spook of this one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been about this
Church a many years, but I&rsquo;ve never seen you
before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the spook, &ldquo;is because you&rsquo;ve
always been moving about. I&rsquo;m very flimsy&mdash;very
flimsy indeed&mdash;and I can only keep myself
together when everything is quite still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got your
chance now. What are you going to do with
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to go out,&rdquo; said the spook, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
tired of this Church, and I&rsquo;ve been alone for six
hundred years. It&rsquo;s a long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It does seem rather a long time,&rdquo; said
Caleb, &ldquo;but why don&rsquo;t you go if you want to?
There&rsquo;s three doors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; said the spook, &ldquo;They keep
me in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;when they&rsquo;re open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open or shut,&rdquo; said the spook, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;what about the
windows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every bit as bad,&rdquo; said the spook, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
all pointed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caleb felt out of his depth. Open doors and
windows that kept a person in&mdash;if it was a
person&mdash;seemed to want a little understanding.
And the flimsier the person, too, the easier it
ought to be for him to go where he wanted.
Also, what could it matter whether they were
pointed or not?</p>

<p>The latter question was the one which Caleb
asked first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Six hundred years ago,&rdquo; said the spook,
&ldquo;all arches were made round, and when these
pointed things came in I cursed them. I hate
new-fangled things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t hurt them much,&rdquo; said
Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said I would never go under one of
them,&rdquo; said the spook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That would matter more to you than to
them,&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does,&rdquo; said the spook, with another great
sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you could easily change your mind,&rdquo;
said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was tied to it,&rdquo; said the spook, &ldquo;I was
told that I never more should go under one
of them, whether I would or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some people will tell you anything,&rdquo;
answered Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a Bishop,&rdquo; explained the spook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s different, of
course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The spook told Caleb how often he had tried
to go under the pointed arches, sometimes of
the doors, sometimes of the windows, and how
a stream of wind always struck him from the
point of the arch, and drifted him back into
the Church. He had long given up trying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have been outside,&rdquo; said Caleb,
&ldquo;before they built the last door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was my Church,&rdquo; said the spook, &ldquo;and
I was too proud to leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caleb began to sympathise with the spook.
He had a pride in the Church himself, and disliked
even to hear another person say Amen
before him. He also began to be a little jealous
of this stranger who had been six hundred years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
in possession of the Church in which Caleb had
believed himself, under the Vicar, to be master.
And he began to plot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you want to get out?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no use here,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
get enough to do to keep myself warm. And I
know there are scores of Churches now without
any kirk-spooks at all. I can hear their cheap
little bells dinging every Sunday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s very few bells hereabouts,&rdquo; said
Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no hereabouts for spooks,&rdquo; said the
other. &ldquo;We can hear any distance you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what good are you at all?&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said the spook. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t we secure
proper respect for Churches, especially after
dark? A Church would be like any other place
if it wasn&rsquo;t for us. You must know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re no good
here. This Church is all right. What will you
give me to let you out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you do it?&rdquo; asked the spook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will you give me?&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say a good word for you amongst the
spooks,&rdquo; said the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What good will that do me?&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good word never did anybody any harm
yet,&rdquo; answered the spook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well then, come along,&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gently then,&rdquo; said the spook; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t make
a draught.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said Caleb, and he drew the spook
very carefully (as one takes a vessel quite full of
water) from the seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go under pointed arches,&rdquo; cried the
spook, as Caleb moved off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody wants you to,&rdquo; said Caleb. &ldquo;Keep
close to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He led the spook down the aisle to the angle
of the wall where a small iron shutter covered
an opening into the flue. It was used by the
chimney sweep alone, but Caleb had another use
for it now. Calling to the spook to keep close,
he suddenly removed the shutter.</p>

<p>The fires were by this time burning briskly.
There was a strong up-draught as the shutter
was removed. Caleb felt something rush across
his face, and heard a cheerful laugh away up in
the chimney. Then he knew that he was alone.
He replaced the shutter, gave another look at
his stoves, took the keys, and made his way
home.</p>

<p>He found his wife asleep in her chair, sat
down and took off his boots, and awakened her
by throwing them across the kitchen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wondering when you&rsquo;d wake,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Have you been in long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at the clock,&rdquo; said Caleb. &ldquo;Half
after twelve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My gracious,&rdquo; said his wife. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be off
to bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you tell her about the spook?&rdquo; he was
naturally asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; said Caleb. &ldquo;You know what
she&rsquo;d say. Same as she always does of a
Saturday night.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="tb">*<span class="ast">*</span><span class="ast">*</span><span class="ast">*</span><span class="ast">*</span><span class="ast">*</span><span class="ast">*</span></p>

<p>This fable Mr. Batchel related with reluctance.
His attitude towards it was wholly
deprecatory. Psychic phenomena, he said, lay
outside the province of the mere humourist,
and the levity with which they had been treated
was largely responsible for the presumptuous
materialism of the age.</p>

<p>He said more, as he warmed to the subject,
than can here be repeated. The reader of the
foregoing tales, however, will be interested to
know that Mr. Batchel&rsquo;s own attitude was one
of humble curiosity. He refused even to guess
why the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revenant</i> was sometimes invisible, and
at other times partly or wholly visible; sometimes
capable of using physical force, and at
other times powerless. He knew that they had
their periods, and that was all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>There is room, he said, for the romancer in
these matters; but for the humourist, none.
Romance was the play of intelligence about
the confines of truth. The invisible world, like
the visible, must have its romancers, its
explorers, and its interpreters; but the time
of the last was not yet come.</p>

<p>Criticism, he observed in conclusion, was
wholesome and necessary. But of the idle and
mischievous remarks which were wont to pose
as criticism, he held none in so much contempt
as the cheap and irrational <strong class="smcap">Pooh-Pooh</strong>.</p>
